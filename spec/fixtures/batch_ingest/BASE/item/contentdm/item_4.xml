    <Transcription>FOREWORD   Standing in willis Park and confronting any side of the square it is easy to remember Bainbridge as it was fifty years ago. Asphalt streets fade into rough brick paving, stores change; there are islands of quietness where you can hear birds in the park and voices. Mr. Brady in his dry goods store expertly measures cloth from a bolt by holding it along his extended left arm, drawing the cloth to the tip of his nose with his right hand and repeating as often as necessary. Mr. Haddon stands in the open doorway of Haddon's Department Store watching the delivery boy at Ehrlich Drug Co. across the street repair a link in his bicycle chain. He turns around and proudly surveys his store, the only store in town with a mezzanine, on which he intends to display toys at Christmas. Mrs. Maddox and one of the Mrs. Bowers, wearing similar dark prints with hems at the calf, are talking in front of the A &amp; P while two bag boys load their groceries. Maybelle Hawes and Willie Mae Howell are having curb service at Overstreet Drug Co. on the other side of Willis Park. Four blocks away at Riverside Hospital Dr. Gordon Chason and Dr. R.F. Wheat are trying to get a patient whose appendix they took out earlier to stop moaning and crying for help. The hospital smells of ether and alcohol. Hodges, the obese head nurse, who, in spite of her severe haircut and masculine demeanor is pretty when she   laughs, puts a hypodermic needle into the man's upper arm. The hospital walls are bare and the patient's moans bounce off the ceramic tile wainscotting in the long hallway echoing and amplifying alarmingly. On the other side of town windows are open in all the classrooms of the grammar school. They are tall heavy windows with Thanksgiving turkeys cut out of yellow and orange construction paper stuck to the panes. Several yellow jackets float lazily in and out of the rooms through the open windows. Occasionally one will drift close to the head of one of the children and cause a commotion.   The children are hot and flatulent and even with the windows open the air is stale. A person walking by on Potter Street could hear, if they listened, the voice of each teacher.   The voices have died away. Time propels us headlong and memory is our only grip on the past. Every fall with the first frost I become nostalgic. I remember certain things from my childhood. I remember vividly Broughton Street as seen from my bicycle with wind blowing in my eyes and the frigid air bringing tears. It causes me to experience, not what I felt then, but sentiment fashioned out of the distance between then and now. Sadly the reality itself has been swallowed by time, and that realization is like looking down in the split second before his jaws close, and seeing both your legs in a shark's mouth. The present becomes the past before we can see ourselves standing in it. If it weren't for memory we'd have nothing. Memory, like a choice cut from the flank of reality, affords life what continuity it has and makes us what we are ---human beings. Photography has become an indispensible part of society's memory.   People ask why I spend my life documenting a simple place like Decatur County. They confuse simple with small. There are no simple places or simple lives. The problems Decatur Countians face may be unlike the problems of urban life, but they are no less threatening and therefore exacting. Fulfillment and self-respect are as necessary but elusive here as elsewhere.   Having been born and raised in Decatur County, I know it like I know myself. Its understated landscape and prosaic s~ructures comfort me with their familiarity, like a mother suckling her child. It is the first bit of the world my new eyes saw and later I learned to feel secure in its familiarity. The places where we spend our childhood and adolescence do much to set the tone of our subsequent lives. For that and other reasons it is important to know the institutions, the history, the economy, even the buildings and the landscape--insofar as they determined the lives of forebears  -as parameters within which we develop.   Decatur County, like all places, was shaped by history and geography. For almost a century after its establishment in 1823, it was isolated and sparsely settled. Decatur Countian's dependence on land and climate for a meagre livelihood made them practical people. The social and religious institutions they formed, the buildings they erected, and the boundaries that were imposed on their minds and imaginations were necessities of the rural life of their time. They were products of the land as much as their crops. Their concerns were for survival. They lived in daily contact with the elemental threat of extinction. Even in more recent times, the blessings of science have been offset by the curse of an inscrutable economy, which is as ominous as drought and insects ever were. If I grasp these verities, I begin to better understand not only the place but myself in relationship to it, and my photographic document becomes a lifetime search for my emotional origins.   I have spent most of my life in observation, contemplation, and reaction, and for a long time I did not know what to do with the feelings my nature engendered. They were often overwhelming and occurred faster than I could assimilate them. Our culture affords us a map of detailed possibilities, but living is the sensuous, unpredictable realization of those possibilities just as music is the sensual fulfillment of printed notes.   One day before I knew what to photograph I was driving around the southern part of the county where shade tobacco was grown. It was June and tobacco stalks were bursting through the cheese cloth shades. Black field crews were picking the highest leaves and stacking them on wagons which would take them to the barns. I photographed until I ran out of film. Then I just watched. At the end of the day I had learned a lot about shade tobacco and felt surprisingly close to these carefree seeming people whose lives I knew were anything but carefree. I left feeling exhilarated.   I went back every afternoon, until one day the field was empty. I stood among the stripped stalks where the day before there had been movement and voices. There was silence and stillness except, I recall, for a crow perched on a power line who was upset by my presence. The field, which until now had been the object of such care and concern, was used up. The leaves were all in the barns, and the people were gone to another farm. There was mystery in the wreckage of the field. Instantly I seemed to assimilate everything I had seen during the last week, the work and the social interplay. It added up to feelings too complex and far-flung for words. Only photographs with their capacity to render that which cannot be further reduced would suffice. Later I had a similar experience photographing Battle's Quarters. I was standing in the middle of one of its two narrow, dusty streets looking through the view finder at some children playing when I felt as though I were roughly jerked out of a sound restful sleep into blinding, heartless light. Human beings were surviving without hope, yet every morning they rose and faced another day with vitality and absurd innocence. My feelings were urgent and powerful, brought to consciousness by what I saw, which showed me that I could not expect to "make" photographs. I had to find them. In this groping, testing way, selecting subject matter by the roughness with which it tore me from my complacency I stumbled toward what was to become my subject, Decatur County.   To do justice to a project of this scope one must give unlimited time. The photojournalist intentionally deals w~th the world in a broad, expeditious way: his audience wants only a smattering of what's going on. My documentation of Decatur County addresses a more involved spectator, one who is willing to experience the place emotionally and as an enigma, which necessitates a different time scale.   I rely on instinct to recognize the possibilities for a photograph. Some would find this difficult at home where familiarity blinds. But familiarity is indispensable for   my kind of pictures. How else would you express the desolation a house you have known all your life, passed every day on your way to school, must feel as it is being torn down, eviscerated, its innards scattered across what was once the lawn that proudly adorned it? Familiarity may blind the photographer who is satisfied to skim the surface, but the analyzing eye and the sensitive heart that have memorized every detail of a place from a lifetime of living in it and   feeling it as a reference point, reacts most strongly and   examines closest what it knows best.   I have tried to structure my work in such a way as to suggest the simultaneity and layering of real life. The community does not exist in isolated fragments like photographic images nor in frozen time. An essence of reality is violated when the continuity and flow of life is broken in its transfer to a photograph. Remind yourself that activity in the court house goes on simultaneously with work in factories and on farms. Prayer meetings and church services overlap shopping and the people in church are jurors at the court house. Sunday's picnickers are machine operators on Monday. Every citizen wears many hats, and all the while houses stand looking out on their streets and cemeteries silently wait.   I stand before the Confederate Soldier in the center of the town square, Willis Park, and contemplate Bainbridge on all sides radiating out like brain waves from the soldier as though in a despairing moment he had caused it to materialize. Aesthetically the town is banal and graceless. The ge?erations who built it could barely afford to be expedient, much less stylish. But in many ways it is the perfect artifact and documents the quality and values of their struggle. The challenge is to see beyond the mediocrity to their stamina and determination to squeeze from life something they could use.   The instinct to survive and understand something of   our chaotic world, to love and be loved, to have dignity,   self-respect, and some degree of success, at least in our   own eyes, are common to us all. We have our work, our spiritual, our social, and our economic obligations to honor, and it is often on one of these fronts that we stand toe to toe with our demons. When I aim my camera at religion, people at work, or the court house, I am stalking major themes in which the viewer can discover himself as in a mirror.   Because I chose to live here all my life I make my photographs out of the sentiment of familiarity, the volatility of time, and a strong sense of our mortality. I believe we must acknowledge our nature and finally settle for being human, no matter where or how we live. Everything flows into our humanity, and it is this that the document is really about.   Decatur County is not simple. Life here is all that life is everywhere, and I cannot think of a higher goal than understanding what we can of it.  </Transcription>
