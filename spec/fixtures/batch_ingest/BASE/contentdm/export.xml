    <Description>Caption by photographer (Kwilecki): &quot;This is the one dirt street comprising the quarters. Children play in it. Originally built to house workers at Battle's Lumber Co., it outlived its original purpose by forty years. It was a terrible slum. It has been torn down.&quot;</Description>

    <Description>Caption by photographer (Kwilecki): &quot;The houses were impossible to heat in winter, cool in summer, or otherwise made comfortable. Consequently, most life was lived on the porches and in the yards. The man at right is the Quarter's stud, and this is one of his girl friends.&quot;</Description>

    <Subject>Pope, Laura</Subject>
    <Description>Caption by photographer (Kwilecki): &quot;These statues were constructed during and shortly after World War I by a genuine eccentric in Grady County named Laura Pope. At one time there were over a hundred such life-size statues standing in the yard. All were of soldiers or nurses or spirits. She made life-masks for the faces and concrete for the bodies, which were stylized and awkwardly rendered.&quot;</Description>

    <Description>Caption by photographer (Kwilecki): &quot;This is typical of the change from old to new church buildings by small congregations out in the sparsely populated county. Unfortunately in most cases the new structures don't measure up to the old. Instead of wood they use concrete block. Instead of blending into the landscape, they are a caustic white and stand out.&quot;</Description>

    <Description>Caption by photographer (Kwilecki): &quot;This is the first image in a group of six that tells the story of Mt. Horum. Once a relatively active congregation, it declined until finally one Sunday the worshipers left and never came back. The altar, pews, even the prayer books remain, but the grounds are grown up in weeds and saplings.&quot;</Description>

    <Transcription>SHADE TOBACCO   Shade tobacco was an elegant and exotic crop. It's leaves were used for cigar wrappers which meant they had to be perfect: good color, excellent consistency, and above all no holes. It was grown under cheesecloth shades that covered an entire field, it was planted and fertilized by hand, the furrows ploughed with mules, and the leaves picked by hand. They were taken to cathedral-like barns with dirt floors, murky light, and cool, aromatic air where they were strung on sticks and hung up to cure. This kind of tobacco was grown in the U. S. in only two places: a small area around Attapulgus fourteen miles south of Bainbridge and Connecticut. Today it is not grown in either place. The homogenized wrapper compressed from shredded tobacco and the minimum wage law put American growers out of the business.   Shade tobacco farms were in several ways the last vestiges of antebellum plantations. Large farms had &quot;quarters&quot; for the field hands, many of whom grew up in tobacco, their parents haVing worked in it all their lives. Owners took paternalistic responsibility for their welfare. They found work for them when tobacco was out of season, loaned them money when they needed it, and often got them out of scrapes with the law.   Shade tobacco was an expensive crop. In the late 1950s it could cost as much as seven thousand dollars per acre and anumber of things might go wrong: a hail storm could wipe out a crop in ten minutes. In the days before irrigation rainfall was critical. A freeze, in late March or April could kill all the plants and new ones would have to be set out. Most uncertain of all was the market. A perfect crop might not bring enough money to repay the bank. Obviously shade tobacco planters were gamblers. A good year could be incredibly profitable but I have seen farmers of substance go under from two or three consecutively bad years.   Tobacco hands were originals. One, a black man of thirty, was a born leader. He was quiet and rather grave. The others listened when he spoke and followed his directions with uncharacteristic seriousness. He had nine children. I made a portrait of him at his home, a Jim Walter house sixteen by thirty-two feet, where all eleven lived.   Jim Walter houses were shell houses. He bought his for a small down payment and a thirty year note. The interest accrued fast enough to offset his monthly payments so the balance could never be liquidated. It was up to him to put in the floor, sheetrock, wiring, plumbing, and paint.   A few months after the picture was made, he couldn't pay the note on the house and pay for the materials to finish it. He had other payments too: an old car he drove to work, a refrigerator, a washing machine, a stove, a TV, and an air conditioner. The only sensible way out was to leave the house and forfeit the down payment and equity. He would not do that, so he had to get money elsewhere. A year later he was arrested for having a whiskey still in his back yard. When he got out of jail he gave up and left town.   Most of the people in these pictures could tell similar stories. They were hearty with Vitality to burn, but options were few and not promising, which may partially explain their robust humor and their raucous conversation. While waiting for wagons to come back from the barns the men in the fields shot craps or wrestled. The women talked. They worked hard: they played hard, and they were beautiful doing both. The picture of the woman hoeing among the young tobacco plants sums up a special beauty I kept seeing. The clothes she's wearing, the body under those clothes, and the strength in her face and neck shows that human beings can still look (and perhaps be) heroic. The woman sitting on a bench in the sunshine in front of her typical tobacco shack, has her own poise. As does the pregnant mother combing her child's hair on the front porch of a two-family shack.   The life the tobacco hands lived was backbreaking and full   of trouble. From the inside there was nothing beautiful about it,   but from outside, to an observer who could get beyond cliches, there was interminable stamina. Underneath their talk and laughter, their quick temper and their bawdy behavior, they resisted being put aside and wore sadness like an insignia. It was not self-pity; it was more worldweariness. disappointment that life was not better. It was in their eyes and especially in their innocence.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>BATTLE'S QUARTERS   Battle's Quarters was the worst of several black slums in Bainbridge. It was two one-block streets of cheap houses built as living quarters for Battles q Metcalf Lumber Co. workers. The lumber company closed in the forties and the houses were rented out to blacks who lacked income to live in a decent place. Battle's Quarters was, as Balzac described the house in Pere Goriot, poverty without poetry.   The streets were dirt. When it rained muddy water stood everywhere, and the smell of urine and stale fried food hung in the air. There was not a tree on either street; people sat in the shade of their houses and moved as the sun moved the shade. In dry weather the dust was suffocating.   Battle's Quarters was a new kind of slum in which the dehumanization of its tenants was faster and more thorough than before. Many residents received welfare checks for not working or for bearing illegitimate children. Money was given them with no responsibility to use it prudently. Consequently they threw it away and the whole idea of career or job lost its meaning.   The houses were narrow, one room wide. The first two rooms were bedrooms, the back room a kitchen. There was a porch on the front and a stoop in back. About fifty feet behind the house was a priVY. There was no way to make the houses comfortable in winter or summer. Consequently most life was lived outdoors.   Both men and women seemed to adjust to liVing conditions   in the quarters by suspending their concept of privacy and any rigid   idea of time. They sat in groups of four or five in their yards, on   their porches, or on their old cars which were big and banged up.   They would leave their group to eat, not on a schedule but whenever   they were hungry. They might return or go to bed or lie on the splintered floor of the porch and sleep. Someone else would take their place, so the individuals changed, but the group itself remained. Two blocks away, outside the quarters such behavior would have been bizarre.   At first I was cautious about photographing people and pretended to be taking pictures of the street. I discovered right away that I was not an object of interest; people did not look at me or ask what I was doing. When I realized they were totally indifferent to outsiders, I began getting closer and photographing individuals. I was beginning to see that these people had nothing to fear from anyone: they had lost everything even their self-esteem and with that a good bit of their hold on reality.   Finally Battle's Quarters became unbearable to the people who lived around it and daily saw what it was doing to its victims. For several years they resolutely protested its indecency, and finally it was demolished. Now there is a dirt road going nowhere. On both sides grass and weeds grow head high. Its as if the place imploded of its own putrefaction and like a black hole took everything with it. A few wild flowers that blow in the fresh air are all that's left.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>The Soldier in Willis Park   The Confederate soldier in Willis Park looks east across Broad Street, which is the main route for funerals and parades, and hundreds of Decatur Countians pass him daily on their way to the courthouse, post office, or to shop.   Most people don't really look at him. When you do, you see a handsome face with fine features and a firm-set jaw. It is more the face of a philosopher than a soldier. He seems to be looking not merely across Broad Street but into a doubtful future.   He was put in Willis Park when the old courthouse was torn down eighty-six years ago. At first he had the park to himself except for paved walks, and five or six handsome oaks. Now there's an oversized gazebo, three cannon, a time capsule, and enough granite and marble memorials to start a cemetery.   I don't think of the soldier as marble. To me he is more spirit than substance. For example, I'm sure he remembers in 1918 when R. H. May, a cashier in the Citizen's Bank &amp; Trust Co. across Water Street, shot and killed Mr. Richardson in the bank. Richardson was a contractor and had the First Baptist Church under construction. In a packed courtroom within a hundred yards of the soldier, May was given eighteen years. He served eighteen months and got a reprieve. He moved to Florida, went into business, shot his partner, and died before he could be tried.   The soldier didn't have to turn his head to witness the Mercer Baggs-John Hunter duel. It took place less than seventy-five feet in front of him. Baggs and Hunter were young partners in a furniture business. They had an argument and Baggs said if he saw Hunter again he'd kill him. After that they both went armed. They met one morning on the sidewalk in front of the soldier. Baggs dropped to one knee, took careful aim, and fired. Hunter shot from a standing position and was killed on the spot. Baggs was wounded in the neck and carried to the Bon Air Hotel a few feet away. He survived.   In 1936 the soldier watched dumbly as a truck drug the tarred and feathered body of a black man accused of murder around and around the square by torch light, horns blowing, men bellowing in a frenzy of rage. And less minacious but equally passionate, the victory celebration when World War II ended.   At night while the town sleeps the soldier may consider the speechmakers who have passed in review, men determined to influence Decatur Countians in one way or another: for gamut, Gene Talmadge and the Elder W. W. Taylor, whose oratory had but one thing in common, passion. Talmadge yelled white supremacy and merchandised the county unit system, which claimed to maintain an equitable political balance between rural and urban Georgia. The Elder W. W. Taylor was a part time preacher without a congregation. On Saturday afternoons he mounted a wooden Winchester gun shell case on Broad Street and for an hour-and-a-half rendered his egocentric vision of cosmic reality. He rarely had an audience except for passersby, but for him there was joy in just preaching.   This and much else has gone on around the soldier. Businesses have come and gone, the truck has replaced the horse and wagon, and some colorful local history has passed before him. Although it is easy to walk through Willis Park and not look closely, it can be stimulating to get better acquainted. The soldier could become more icon than statue.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>STORES   Almost all of my grandfather's business day was spent waiting on customers in his small hardware store. When the last customer had left (there was no such thing as store hours), and that was often ten o'clock in the evening, he set about doing the necessary book work, ordering merchandise, and writing a few letters. In those days the social ingredient, interacting with the customer, was primary. The technical details of running the business, those things that were done in the privacy of an office, came when there was nothing more pressing.   For many years after that, shopping and selling were eye to eye. Customers relied on the knowledge and integrity of salespeople and the fairness and understanding of the merchant. We had many farm customers who bought supplies in late winter and paid nothing on their accounts until fall when they sold their crops. No note was signed, merely a notation on the ledger card saying Fall Terms.   The changes didn't happen overnight. They started after World War II. The small independent merchant who had been the backbone of the town was hit by competition from big chain stores that came with mass merchandising, self-service, discount pricing, and national advertising.   In 1945, stores carried only merchandise for which a market existed. Now markets are created by advertising and easy credit; sales floors overflow with merchandise. Stores are no different in Bainbridge from those found all over the country. They carry the same goods and they look alike. This uniformity is said to be an advantage. But shopping has become solitary and asocial. I stationed myself in several large stores and photographed customers unaware that they were being observed. They moved from isle to isle, but, like robots, showed no animation. They looked sour and belligerent, scanning the shelves with intensity and anxiety more appropriate to stalking than shopping. True, Bainbridge has lost some of its isolation; but put another way it has lost some of its privacy and more important some of its intimacy.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>Tobacco Residue   In September 1982, I decided to have a look at what was happening to former shade tobacco farms. I drove past Fowltown to one that had been prosperous. As such it had quarters: houses, inadequate during the halcyon years of tobacco, that had become less habitable with vacancy. One stood separate from the rest and had a large fig tree in the front yard which shaded the porch and provided a family of cats with limbs on which to sun themselves. An old man was sitting in the swing eating his dinner out of a tin plate.   He put his plate down and looked at me. He had on a flannel shirt and hand-me-down cotton trousers many sizes too big. When he stood I saw that he was frail and stiff. He shuffled forward, straining through weak milky eyes to see me. Standing in the sunlight he looked like God. I made two quick shots.   &quot;Do you mind if I take some pictures?&quot; I asked slyly.   &quot;I ain't done nothing,&quot; he said. &quot;I ain't botherin nobody.&quot;   &quot;I know. I just want to take your picture,&quot; I said.   A large woman who had been listening came out. She said go ahead and take the pictures that the old man didn't understand.   The door was open and I could see into the front room which was empty except for a sofa by the window and a table. She lead him to the sofa, and I began taking pictures.   &quot;I ain't done nothing,&quot; he said again. He still looked like God, the sun, his own creation, shining on his dark old skin. He watched me quietly with dignity. I hoped a little of what I felt would reach the film.   When I finished I thanked him, but I don't think he heard me. He was sitting by the window, enjoying the warm shunshine. A cat was eating his dinner, which he had forgotten, in the swing on the front porch.   On the same farm, I passed a house so miserable I assumed it was vacant. The front door was on the ground under the sill where the steps had been. Weeds were roof high. Four children, one naked, were trying to ride a single tricycle on the hard dirt. The stench of sour water and garbage was everywhere.   As I got closer I could see an elderly woman with a can of   beer in her hand standing in the doorway.  Carefully she lowered    herself to the ground.    &quot;Who you looking for?&quot; she asked.    &quot;Nobody  particularly,&quot;  I  said.  &quot;I'm  a  photographer.  You    live here?&quot;    &quot;Right  here.&quot;  She  drained  her  beer  and  looked  me  over.    &quot;You from welfare?&quot;      &quot;No,&quot; I said. She was glaring at me. &quot;That's a hell of a house,&quot; I said. &quot;You right about that,&quot; she said. &quot;But aint nothing we can   do but live in it. We aint got enough to feed all these grans.&quot;   &quot;Where's their father?&quot;   &quot;Shit!&quot; she said.   &quot;Where's their mother?&quot;   She nodded toward the house. A five year old girl came   up and clung to her grandmother's skirt. &quot;She don't play with the others,&quot; she said. The girl's face was dirty, but her hair was neatly braided in two pigtails. &quot;That's her tricycle,&quot; the grandmother said, &quot;but she don't ride it. They bout tore it up,&quot; she said indicating the other children. She looked down and rubbed the top of the child's head. For a moment her face relaxed, then anger came.   &quot;She stayed in Florida with her auntie. Then her auntie got married. Her new husband didn't want younguns so they brought her back Christmas Eve and put her out. I didn't know she'd be here Christmas. It was all I could do to get Sandy Claus for them others. I didn't have nothing for her. I hated it. I knowed she was going to cry. But she just say, 'What's the matter with me?' an acted like she didn't care. I say, 'Tomorrow we going to the store an get you Christmas.'&quot; The child was taking in every word.   A thin younger woman with long, uncombed hair appeared in the doorway. She had on a filthy housecoat. &quot;Mama, where's the cereal?&quot; she shouted. A young man in underwear stepped from behind her onto the ground and went into the privy.   &quot;Gh Jesus,&quot; the grandmother said forbearingly and started toward the house to get the cereal. She tossed the empty beer can which she had squeezed into an hourglass beyond the weeds. Her daughter went back inside. The young stud came out of the privy and hopped spryly into the house.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>DR. GORDON CHASON: 1876-1974   When Dr. Gordon Chason began his medical practice around the turn of the century medicine was still a sanguine laying on of hands with the patient at the focus. By the time he retired, it had become a purely scientific discipline, detached and mechanized, with the ailment and its pathology instead of the patient its engrossing interest.   Dr. Gordon Chason did not look anything like the flaccid, insipid country doctor of the movies. He was lean and tall, slightly swarthy, and patrician. He had thinning gray hair, a high, square forehead that suggested seasoned intelligence. His movements, like his speech, were slow and solemn.   He was a born physician. He performed his examinations with routine equipment: the throat with flashlight and tongue depressor, the chest with stethoscope, and palpation of the belly with his two hands. They were dark, hairy hands, sensitive and experienced. As he moved the stethoscope from point to point across your chest, his eyes stared blankly into space, as though shut down for a moment to intensify the acuity of his ears. Reason, deduction, and instinct were tools of his art and with his prodigious capacity to concentrate regardless of surroundings, he was able to unravel obscure and complicated syndromes. When he made a diagnosis it was unadorned and accurate.   Dr. Chason was the attending physician when I was born in 1928 and remained our family doctor until he retired. As a child I suffered from asthma and bronchitis, so Dr. Chason was a frequent visitor. He drove a brown Dodge coupe, the sound of which I could recognize as it pulled up to the curb under my window. I listened for the door to slam, for his footsteps on our walk, for the door bell, and finally for him and my mother to come up the stairs to my room. He would stand in the doorway, his black satchel by his right side which made him lean slightly left, and look at me from that distance for a second before coming into the room. When he entered he brought a bit of the outdoors with him: in winter a thin layer of cold air seemed to hang about him. He also brought a small quanta of energy from the world outside my sick room, enough to make me realize that the worst part of illness is isolation. I was in both fear and awe of Dr. Chason: fear because he could and had inflicted pain on me; awe because I had heard my mother and father speak reverently of him.   When I was seven or eight years old, in the days before Novocaine was used for such minor surgery, I had an episode of boils, many of which had to be opened. As my mother and I sat in Dr. Chason's waiting room, I tried to prepare myself for the pain by imagining the events leading up to it and then the pain itself, as though preparation might make it tolerable. This agony of waiting, however, was preferable to the reality: crossing the hall to Dr. Chason's office and having him put me on a stool directly under a bare light bulb. He would roughly remove the bandage, examine the boil and at that moment decide whether to apply salve to further bring it to a head, which meant a reprieve of a day or two, or lance it then. If the decision were to lance he would get up and go to a dark corner of the room and light a glass alcohol burner over which he would place a spoon. In the spoon was a small amount of water and the tiny blade he would use. I scrutinized him for the first sign of a decision. When it came my heart would either be light with relief or I would loose control and start to cry and struggle, in which case Dr. Chason would smile indulgently and get Dr. Wheat or Dr. Wilkinson from the adjoining office to come in and hold me. It is remarkable that any real feeling for Dr. Chason survived those years of being helplessly afraid and unable to explicate and transcend my instinct.   On his ninetieth birthday his daughter invited old friends to come by. As I entered I saw him sitting erect in an uncomfortable looking Victorian chair across the room, accepting the congratulations of a line of well-wishers. He looked very much as he had always looked, dignified and elegant. When it was my turn to shake his hand, in the instant when my hand touched his, I recalled the sensitivity and intelligence that were in his hands and how skillfully, confidently, and with what imagination he had used them to save lives. My feelings for him were contradictory but solid. I was about to say something when he looked at my face, and for a moment he seemed unsure who I was. Then he recognized me, and he smiled broadly and warmly, and I had the impression he was remembering me in his office, sobbing and resisting; and for some obscure reason at that particular moment I knew that despite my histrionic displays of fear, the intensity of my fear never got through to him. He had no idea it was he who introduced me to the anticipation of pain and its accompanying self-doubt.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>MAX KWILECKI: 1885 -1960   GRACE RICE BAGGS KWILECKI: 1887 -1963     Max Kwilecki died quietly of heart failure on the last day of November 1960. His heart simply gave out. For seventy-five years it had been the source of the most single-minded passion; the kind poems and plays are written about. But the poems and plays, oversimplifications which usually end sadly, seldom tell the whole story. They don't tell of the violent wake created by the energy and recklessness of lovers and how it can swamp the lives of innocent bystanders, nor do they acknowledge that in reality affairs sometimes end happily.   ****   The Isidore Kwilecki family, in which Max was the fourth of eight children, lived on the corner of Donalson and Florida Streets. Tom and Maude Battle had the house next door. When Maude's sister, Grace Rice, came to live with them from Savannah after both parents died, she and Max became sweethearts. Their love ripened so quickly that both families became apprehensive. At first the families threw only small impediments in their way, the kind one barely notices. When it seemed they might marry, or worse, become lovers, the objections grew stronger. It was a marriage neither family could sanction: the Kwileckis because Grace was not Jewish, the Battles because Max was. Grace impetuously began dating a variety of men. One of these, Mercer Baggs, was hot tempered and erratic and seven years her senior. No one, not even Grace herself could explain what happened next: Grace married Mercer. For a brief time both the Battles and the Kwileckis breathed premature sighs of relief.   No sooner were Grace and Mercer back from their wedding trip, than Max began calling Grace when Mercer left the house. They met clandestinely at first, then less cautiously as time went on. Mercer, who had killed his former business partner over a minor argument, learned of the trysts. He said that if Max   did not leave Grace alone he would kill him. Isidore Kwilecki,   already distraught over Max's conduct, became frantic. Bewitched   or not Max had to be separated from Grace Baggs. Isidore sent   Max to Germany to visit relatives for an indefinite period.   He stayed a month and came home.     Max's brothers tried unsuccessfully to separate him from Grace. They opened a hardware store in Tallahassee and sent him to run it. In less than two years Max sold the business and returned. Such pressures had their consequences. Max grew insecure. He developed an insatiable, compensating need to feel important and respected, and anyone with the skill to do it could exploit his vulnerability.   Mercer Baggs died in March of 1936. Conditions looked favorable for a denouement. But Max's brother Julian and his sister Frances, could not bring themselves to ratify the alliance. They were consumed by the idea that Max had made their father's last years miserable. They would not speak to Grace Baggs and finally they would not go any place she might be. This otherwise warmhearted pair took pride in their pious, antiquated stand.   Max had a nervous breakdown and was cared for by a psychiatrist who prescribed marriage to Grace. When Frances heard the news, she fainted. On one side Julian and Frances became even more sanctimonious, while the other brothers and sisters saw no reason, under the circumstances, to continue their objections.   At this point the matter struck a mysterious balance. Max moved to Grace's house, and in every way except legally, adopted her child~en and grandchildren as his own ready-made family. Other than a phobia ---he would not drive on the west side of town past the Kwilecki house where he had lived all his life until he married Grace ---Max had what he wanted.   Their obvious happiness and the unruffled way in which they bore the snubs from Julian and Frances made Max and Grace objects of sympathy. Over a period of years the conflict seemed to have lost its substance, making the two hold-outs appear unreasonable. Shortly before Frances' death in 1954, a truce was declared, and for the first time Max'and Grace were unopposed.   Max relaxed. He sold his interest in the business. Four days a week he played golf. He was stable and secure and faithful. He and Grace spent their evenings going to the movies or watching television. Having survived what Romeo and Juliet failed to survive, they enjoyed the anonymity of an uneventful marriage.   Max lived to be seventy-five and is buried in the Kwilecki lot in the Jewish part of Oak City Cemetery. On his stone is written, &quot;Husband of Grace Baggs.&quot; Grace lived to be seventy-six and is buried in the Baggs lot next to Mercer. On her stone her name appears, &quot;Grace Rice Kwilecki.&quot;  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>SHELDON S. BRINSON: 1917 -1988   LIEUTENANT SHELDON BRINSON HELPS BAG SEVEN J AP FIGHTERS   Lieutenant Sheldon Brinson, U.S. Army Air Corps stationed somewhere in New Guinea was one of ten American fighter pilots who had stars placed after their names on the bulletin board of their air base, when they returned from a patrol over the Buna area of New Guinea and established without a doubt seven Japanese fighters and damaged several others.   Lieutenant Brinson is a graduate of the Bainbridge High School and later attended the University of Florida and enlisted in U. S. Army Air Corps during the early part of 1942. He is the son of Mrs. S. A. Brinson of this city and the late Sheldon S. Brinson.   He is well known in Bainbridge where he is a popular member of the younger contingent. Post-Searchlight, December 3, 1942. Front Page.   SHELDON S. BRINSON PROMOTED TO MAJOR   Now Serving as Pilot and Operations Officer   With Ninth Air Force     Sheldon S. Brinson, veteran of 152 missions in the Pacific Theatre of Operations, and now pilot, and operations officer with a U. S. Ninth Air Force Thunderbolt group, has been promoted to major. ..   On his 152nd and last mission in New Guinea, Major Brinson and five other pilots attacked nine Japanese bombers and approximately 50 fighters. Major Brinson was wounded as he attacked a bomber from astern. Concussion from a 20 millimeter shell from the bomber knocked him unconscious, shattered his canopy and jammed it so that escape from his crippled plane was impossible, he discovered on recovering consciousness. He crash-landed and was hospitalized a month before he was returned to the United States.   He flies a P-47 Thunderbolt with the IIHun Hunterll group in France. Post-Searchlight, November 30,1944. Front Page.   LOCAL PILOT MEETS BROTHER-IN-LAW IN GERMANY   The age old axiom that IIIt's a small world after allll even in the front lines of Germany, came true when Major Sheldon Brinson of this city met his brother-in-law, Capt. Milton Brownlee, of Gainesville, Fla. somewhere in Germany.   Major Brinson who is a P-47 pilot with the Ninth Air Force in France, knew that Capt. Brownlee was near his field with the First Army. Duties had prevented him from contacting his brother-in-law until he had a few free days. He then set out to have a reunion.   Traveling to within 30 miles of the front lines, he communicated   with Capt. Brownlee, who was allowed to visit his brother-in-law.   During the 24 hour visit, the first time the two had seen each other in three years, they undertook the good ole American custom of bargaining. Major Brinson swapped a fur lined flying suit he was wearing for a captured Mauser pistol, which belonged to Capt. Brownlee.   The wife of Captain Brownlee, the former Miss Mamie Hinley Brinson, resides here with her mother, Mrs. S. A. Brinson. Post-Searchlight, December 7, 1944.   MAJOR BRINSON COMMANDS SQUADRON OF HUN HUNTERS   Major Sheldon S. Brinson, Bainbridge, Ga., P-47 pilot, and the squadron commanded by him, so impeded a recent German panzer advance that a divisional command post and a half million gallons of gasoline, prime objective of the Germanswere evacuated from Belgium, northern hinge of the German offensive thrust toward Liege.   Continued bombing and strafing attacks wrecked enemy tanks and vehicles and forced the German troops into cover, giving the American troops sufficient time to evacuate the gasoline sought by the Nazis.   Of 12 Messerschmitt-l 09s that attacked the Thunderbolt fighter bombers hoping to break up the American attack, one was destroyed and one damaged...   LT. COL. SHELDON BRINSON VISITING HERE THIS WEEK   Lt. Co. Sheldon Brinson, son of Mrs. S. A. Brinson of this city, arrived in Bainbridge this week with his wife, the former Miss Frances Owens, for a short visit.   Lt. Col. Brinson returned to the states last week after serving eleven months in the European Theatre of Operations, as a squadron commander of the 366th Fighter Group, the Hun Hunters, of the Ninth Air Force in Germany. He is a veteran P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bomber pilot and has to his credit more than 150 missions in the Pacific Theatre. During his service in the Pacific and European theatres he was awarded the Silver Star Medal, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Oak Leaf Clusters, the Purple Heart and the Air Medal with eight Oak Leaf Clusters. Post-Searchlight, July 26, 1945, Front Page.   COL. SHELDON S. BRINSON   Col. Sheldon Smith Brinson, USAF Ret., 71 of Tallahassee, Fla., died   Friday September 30, 1988 at Tallahassee Memorial Regional Medical   Center.

    <Transcription>Ugly Duckling Becomes Swan   Walter Bracken, owner of the Callahan Theatre, used to say, &quot;The best is none to good for Bainbridge.&quot; But the Ritz put the Callahan out of business about 1933.   That left one movie house in town, the Ritz, on Broad Street across from Willis Park. If the Ritz had been a hotel, it would have been called a flea-bag. It was in a two-story mercantile building from which the second floor had been removed. Built for vaudeville as well as movies, the stage was spacious and high with two dressing rooms at back. A thousand seats were crowded into the auditorium over which hung the stale smell of people and popcorn. Other than a few exit signs and five dim lights down each side, the walls were bare. The balcony had a partition: blacks on one side, whites on the other. The last rows, under the projection booth were where boys from town and soldiers from the air base took pick-ups ~ ilt was the cheapest space in town.   Children usually sat in the first ten rows downstairs. They liked the brightness. They could play when the movie was slow and the larger than life size of the actors confirmed their perception of life. They ran up and down the isles to get food and go to the toilet and the ticket-taker or the manager had to make frequent trips to quiet them.   The Ritz was a navel through which nourishment from the outside world arrived. It consumed two hundred sixty features, two hundred eight cartoons, one hundred four newsreels, sixty one-reel serial episodes, and an indeterminate number of various short subjects every year. Performances began at two-thirty and ran continuously until eleven-thirty. That there were enough people in Bainbridge who could and would go to a movie in the afternoon to justify running it three times before eight o'clock, tells how tempting it was to buy a twenty-five cent ticket and go to the show.   If Macbeth had been written for the Ritz, half way through, Macbeth would have discovered it was not the crown he wanted but to live happily with Lady Macbeth forever. His murder of the king would have been forgiven and forgotten in exchange for his assurance that he had his priorities right at last. On the other hand, had they shown the real Macbeth, the audience would have walked out, confused by the gloom and language of the play. Sentiment and over-simplification was what the Ritz specialized in, and the community couldn't get enough of it. The Ritz's meaning was so apparent, its form and function so seamlessly welded, it was a work of art.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>When a House Dies   In the nineteenth and early twentieth century, most Decatur Countians who built big houses thought nothing of architecture or aesthetics. The subtropical climate required special concessions for the sake of comfort. Houses were well off the ground to catch the slightest breeze and minimize mosquitoes. Windows were large. Exteriors were white or a light color to reflect the sun. Porches on which you could sit after sundown were wide and comfortable like rooms out-of-doors.   My spinster aunt lived in my grandfather's house, built about 1900 for a family of twelve. It was a square box, two stories high with a steep hip roof. Downstairs rooms were gloomy and over furnished with massive sofas, heavy upholstered chairs, and dark, ornamented rugs. Upstairs there was a wide hallway with austere, unused bedrooms on either side. Each had an iron bed, a table, and a rocking chair. There were no rugs or curtains, just shades which were white outside and green inside. When I was a child I liked to go through these rooms on summer afternoons and compulsively lie on each bed with its faded cotton bedspread, which was warm and dusty. I felt safely hidden as long as I stayed in those superfluous rooms. All such houses have rooms or large closets that are rarely opened, and they engender a sense of mystery and expectation.   On co~d nights these old houses glowed from within: some one getting a hot bath, climbing into bed, dreaming, or restlessly waiting for dawn. Their hearths saw pass many small, daily rituals as well as milestone ceremonies: blazing winter fires, Christmas garlands, wedding altars, and coffins with candles at either end.   After supper on warm evenings, my aunt who lived in the house until her death, sat in a swing on the porch and read the newspaper aloud by the light of a black iron floor lamp with a scorched parchment shade. People walking   by on the sidewalk only a few feet away knew her habit and would speak or sometimes stop and visit. When a house dies more than lumber and bricks lie in the rubble.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>The Valentine House   God-fearing people say nobody owns land except God. It's loaned, not owned, and I've seen enough to know that the saying is fact.   For years the Valentines were successful farmers at Lynn Station. They were not rich, but they lived comfortably and their name was known and respected. Now their farms are gone and there's not a Valentine in Decatur County. The home place is rented for next to nothing just to keep it from going to ruin. A man and his wife named Smith live there.   The house looks across a railroad track from a grove of sprawling oaks. When I drove up Mrs. Smith was sweeping leaves in the front yard. She was polite but said she'd have to ask her husband if I could take pictures. She called him from the back where he was planting a spring garden. He came limping through the carport with a small, furry puppy following. He was testy: what did I want with pictures of the house? I explained I was making pictures of older houses in the county before they disappeared. When I asked him to pose in front of it, his surliness vanished.   After Mr. Smith appeared in the front yard, Mrs. Smith said nothing. He told me how he injured his leg, how hard it was to live on his insurance and welfare check, and how he still had to go to the hospital two or three times a year. As he talked he looked me over with his puffy blue eyes. He asked what I did for a living. He asked how much my camera cost and when he could get a print. He was ignorant, maybe a little retarded, and he liked having a stranger to talk to.   He went on talking but I wasn't listening. I wondered if   when the Valentines' lives and fortunes were flourishing and they   were feeling secure, if it ever crossed their minds that time was   a thief and would stealthily take everything they had. Grander   names, Munnerlin for instance, have withered in the Decatur County heat. But one doesn't dwell on the temporality of life when life itself seems safeguarded by luck. When proud houses settle at cockeyed angles and stillness replaces busyness. we reflect.   As I left I understood that the Smiths occupancy was predestined. Theirs was the last name on a list. The house may have been built by the Valentines, but it was now in the possession of the Smiths. Call them scavengers making use of a carcass.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>616 East Broughton Street   My brother is nine years older than I; enough to make him a hero rather than a competitor.   When he came home from college for holidays there was very little time for me. However, on rainy, melancholy afternoons he hung around the house and played the piano. I stood next to him and listened, grateful to the weather for bringing us together.   Our house was never more a house than then. Its roof shielded us from rain and lightening, and its walls kept strangers out. It was a nest, providing a momentary truce with life.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE FLINT RIVER   In this neighborhood, Hernando de Soto and his army discovered the inland waters of the Flint River (&quot;the River of Capacheque&quot;) on Friday, March 5, 1540. Leaving the vicinity of the present Tallahassee, Florida, the Spaniards marched northwest, spent the first night by the Ochlocknee (the Guacucal and reached the Flint two days later at, or near, the present Bainbridge, where they constructed a barge or &quot;peragua&quot; in which to cross.   Frank S. Jones, The History Of Decatur County.   For the next four centuries, the Flint flowing through Decatur County looked much as it did to de Soto and his men, redish brown and menacingly swift. When they saw it in March it was probably not as elegant as it would be in Mayor June when the foliage on the hardwoods and saplings would have been thick and vivid. Then the river's rusty color would have set off the great green forests on either bank.   Approaching from the south and crossing near the site of Bainbridge, de Soto could not have guessed that just twelve miles north the river was different. It washed noisily around limestone boulders which lay in alluvial sand creating rapids and shallows. Downstream where he chose to cross, the river was deeper and wider, even large rocks were submerged, but there were springs on the river bottom and the current was treacherous with whirlpools and snags. This fact, that the river was navigable from the Apalachicola (which emptied into the Gulf of Mexico) as far north as the site where de Soto crossed, was probably a determining factor in the location of the new settlement of Bainbridge years later.   From its founding in 1823, the Flint River influenced the development of Bainbridge, though with an irregular   and unpredictable continuity. By 1850, rlver traffic was an important factor in the local economy. Supplies from Savannah and New Orleans came in. Livestock and produce were shipped out. By the 1930s river traffic, which could not compete with railroads and trucking, had all but disappeared, and it was not untj 1 twenty-five years later that technology and economics made barge transportation the ideal means by which to move thousands of tons of industrial chemicals over long distances. Around 1955 a channel was dredged and Jim Woodruff Dam built creating Lake Seminole from the confluence of the Flint and Chattahoochee, so that once again the Apalachicola and Flint were navigable from the gulf to Bainbridge and tugs and barges plied the river. The state of Georgia designated Bainbridge its first inland port.   The Flint River is the most prominent feature in the Decatur County landscape, and as such has been put to many uses, the most popular of which is recreation. A large basin has been dredged with a slip to the river for launching boats and swimming. At one end the city imported white sand su~gesting the seashore. But there is no breeze and no surf, and by July the water is tepid and stagnant. Nonetheless people go there, perhaps as an alternative to swimming in a public pool or perchance to get as close as is safe to swimming in the river itself. Few, except children, really enJoy the water. Parents lie on the bank and read as they bake in the becalmed, humid brightness. Young couples, almost naked, rub sun tan lotions on each other, while single males drive slowly by, radios blaring, looking for girls or drugs or both.   Competitive fishing has become popular on Lake Seminole and in the river. Big boats with all the leverage that technology affords have taken away much of the innocence and skill. As physicians before the days of elaborate   diagnostic machines used to treat their patients on experience, so fishermen, before the advent of sonar and depth finders, used to locate fish on instinct and a knowledge of nature gleaned from years of practice. Now the river and the lake are promoted to fill the motels and restaurants of the area with hundreds of over equipped sportsmen searching for something darker than the simple thrill of catching a fish.   No one knows how Honey Bee Bluff on a bend in the river a few miles above Bainbridge got its name. It is where lovers parked to watch the moon on the water and feel the darkness and the woods separate them from the real world. Crude jokes were made about it; people smiled and looked knowingly, and now it is covered with deep gullies and garbage.   Memorial Bridge across the Flint connected Bainbridge and West Bainbridge. It was begun in 1922 by Prayton, Howton &amp; Wood Contracting Co. and Pensacola Shipbuilding Co. They discovered while trying to pour pilings in the river bed that there were springs too numerous and too large to fill. They surrendered the contract and Hardaway Contracting Co. and Atlantic Bridge Co. completed the job by persuading the State Highway Department to alter the route of the bridge slightly, thus avoiding the problem. It was finished and opened in 1926. It was a massive, concrete structure with a draw span directly above the channe;. Two previous bridges had been washed away by floods. This one was high and solid enough to endure. It was used without interruption until 1977 when its two   lanes were no longer sufficient to handle the traffic of Highway 84. A new bridge was built and Memorial Bridge was dismantled.   The Flint River has been a part of many lives. People have jumped from the bridge in despair; more have drowned   accidentally. Some have been saved by the muddy water through baptism. My grandfather courted my grandmother who lived in a now vanished settlement called Ocheese on the Apalachicola, by drifting down the river on a raft.   Though some think consciously only of the Flint's commercial or recreational value, few Decatur Countians fail to draw at some time on its aesthetic properties. Just knowing that it is there, a living thing, and is the oldest unchanged landmark in the county, makes it venerable as well as a source of speculation and wonder. Early on a spring morning, when fog hangs just above the water and the turtles and snakes have not yet climbed onto logs and rocks to sun themselves, the peacefulness has a way of reminding one of what the river has seen: Indians and Spanish explorers, steamboats and rafts, rituals investing the water with holy properties, people, men and women, who could not face another hour of life, and lovers.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE TRAILWAYS BUS STATION   The Trailways bus station in Bainbridge is clean. Its ceramic tile floors are scrubbed and polished. The long rows of fluorescent tubes overhead cast blue, flat light over the usual waiting-room paraphernalia: juke box, pinball machine, vending machines, scale, telephones, and rows of chrome and plastic chairs. Once busy from six in the morning until nine at night, the bus station has just four or five buses a day, mostly empty, and freight, not people, keeps it open.   For many years bus travel was a step-child. The bus station was in the back part of a building occupied by Master Auto Parts. Virginia Schultz sold tickets and magazines. She had the biggest newsstand in town, and I remember the smell of magazines mixed with the smell of oil and grease and engine exhaust. The buckled wood floor was dark and sticky with Coke and RC Cola.   After World War II people became more mobile and bus travel flourished. Trailways erected their own bus station. They bought the threadbare but well-bred old Fleming house, and tore it down. The contrast between it and the new bus station was stark. Neighbors shrank from the nocturnal disturbances, but there was nothing they could do about it. Before long the houses around the bus station had turned into a drive-in, a beauty parlor, a drug store, a gas station, and a taxi stand.   The Trailways buses out of Bainbridge went to places with names like Ozark, Enterprise, Opelika in Alabama and Vidalia, Arabi, Winder, and Social Circle in Georgia. They went lots of other places too, but most passengers were not going far. Business people fly; young people and families drive. People traveling alone choose buses because they are inexpensive and go where no other public transportation does. Bainbridge is such a place.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>OAK CITY CEMETERY: W. S. TOWNSEND   After a hundred years   Nobody knows the place, --  Agony, that enacted there,   Motionless as peace.     Weeds triumphant ranged,   Strangers strolled and spelled   At the lone orthography   Of the elder dead.     Winds of summer fields   Recollect the way, --  Instinct picking up the key   Dropped by memory.     Emily Dickinson (202)   A cemetery is like an attic in which a town stores some of its old furniture. The people who walked its streets and lived in its houses leave, as the town's history, a part of their vitality.   The frugal grave of W. S. Townsend, marked by a small granite headstone with his name, birth date, and death date, is misleading, conveying nothing of his blithe, unorthodox life.   He and my father lived less than a block apart and were best friends from childhood. Will saved my father from drowning at a swimming hole. They called each other II HF&quot; but wouldn't tell what it stood for.   One Saturday morning when they were ten my grandmother sent my father and Will in the ox cart to bring clean laundry home from Willis Park where it had been washed in water from an artesian well. Broad Street was deep in mud and pot holes. The laundry was stacked on the back of the cart. A block down Broad Will shot the ox in the rump with his slingshot. The ox kicked and broke, throwing the cart from one set of ruts to the other. When the ox had worn himself out and my father had regained control they looked back to check on the laundry. It lay scattered over Broad Street from Broughton to Shotwell. With fear and trembling they   retrieved it but were unable to think up a good story, so they told my grandmother the truth except they left out the part about the slingshot.   Will dropped out of school in the eighth grade, worked at various jobs around town, got a job as salesman for Frye Pump Co. of Rochester, Pa., and became president of the company within a few years. His gift was salesmanship. He made you feel good about yourself, perhaps because he was resolutely optimistic and could listen as persuasively as he could talk. He bought a yacht which he kept in Miami, and he often invited HF to join him. On one occassion when the yacht was tied up near a restaurant, he had the orchestra from the restaurant come to the pier and play while they had dinner. He was wiped out in the crash of 129.   In New York he made another fortune with Ideas Inc., a business he established to develop and promote new products. Eventually it was brought down by his excesses and recklessness. For example, he tried to determine if his wife and his mistress could live under the same roof for a week. It turned out that they could, but he couldn't. It was no great trouble for Will to get to the top; staying there seemed impossible.   Next he invented a way to evaluate advertising before it was run. He sold his services for enormous fees to some of the largest advertisers in the country, one of whom was Paramount Pictures. He was on his way back from the west coast to Bainbridge to spend Thanksgiving hunting with HF. The train stopped at a station in Arizona where Indians were selling their wares. Attracted to anything novel, he got off and bought, but was particularly curious about the Indians themselves. An Indian selling war drums told him there would be an exhibition dance that evening. Will got his luggage off the train and stayed the night. When he got to Bainbridge, with blankets and war drums, he put on his own exhibition in our living room. After a sufficiency of Scotch, he took one of the drums and danced around the room in a remarkably accurate copy of the rhythm and footwork of the dance. Every second time around he'd tilt his head toward the ceiling and yell, II Kill the white man! Drive out the cattle!1I   There was a trace of megalomania in Willis personality. At the end of World War II he outlined a plan for world peace which would be, if he could sell it, his crowning achievement. The creative energy and enthusiasm he had invested in advertising were now subsumed in this far greater undertaking. He terminated the Townsend Method of Advertising Persuasion and Mass Evaluation by disclosing it in a book, which he sold for one hundred dollars a copy. Once clients and potential clients had the book, they no longer needed his services. The book proved to be a disastrous concept, and his peace plan fiz zled.   Down for the last time, he came back to Bainbridge old, sick, and alone except for HF. People around Bainbridge were kind to him. They remembered the flamboyant days when he would have his chauffeur drive his open Packard touring car through the poor sections of town and hand out fireworks at Christmas.   His grave looks too small. He was bursting with life and wit and a kind of insouciance you don't see anymore; much of which comes back to disturb that quiet, mossy corner of the cemetery every time I go by.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>OAK CITY CEMETERY: EL MANDEVILLE'S STORY   Bainbridge calls itself &quot;The City of Oaks.&quot; It's chief cemetery is on a bluff near the river and is like a park, abundantly shaded by large, ancient live oaks hung with moss. Wisteria is knotted around their trunks and in spring when the dogwood and azaleas bloom, I am struck by the extravagance of flora to see and smell in a place consecrated to the dead. It is a still, dusky place which, despite its gloom, is not unpleasant. I like to go there: it gives me a feeling of walking among the assembled former residents of Bainbridge.   The cemetery is on high ground that could not flood and was an Indian burial ground centuries before the white man came. Grave diggers often unearthed parts of skeletons, arrowheads, and shards.   One afternoon EI Mandeville was passing through the cemetery on his way to the river bank to fish when he saw two men digging a new grave. They were examining a small object. It was the lower jaw of an Indian skull, and they presented it to EI, who was then twelve years old (1910). At supper he showed it to his father who turned it over carefully and agreed that it probably was a human jaw.   &quot;But,&quot; he cautioned soberly, &quot;I don't think I would have brought it here. Suppose this Indian didn't like your having it and comes looking for it.&quot;   &quot;What should I do?&quot; EI asked.   &quot;I'd take it back where it came from,&quot; his father said.   It was too late then to go to the cemetery, so EI took the jaw to his room and put it on the window sill. Next morning before breakfast his father said, &quot;I had a nightmare. I dreamed I heard pounding at the front door. As soon as I was far enough down the steps I saw by an eerie light outside a giant Indian standing on the porch. He was a terrible sight. He must have been eight feet tall and was holding his hand over his mouth. He shook his head fiercely like he was in pain and pointed toward your room. Then I woke up.&quot; Without waiting to eat breakfast, El wrapped the jaw in newspaper and ran to the cemetery. All the way he worried that the grave might have been closed. What would he do then? But it hadn't and he carefully unwrapped the jaw and dropped it in. Then he threw enough dirt on top to hide it.   When El related the story, he paused here a long time. Then he said, &quot;I was never sure whether Papa really had a nightmare like that or whether he made it up just to scare the fell out of El.&quot;   El is buried near the spot where he got the jaw.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>NEGRO CEMETERIES   Rural Negro cemeteries, especially the small, older ones are austere islands in the Decatur County countryside.   Cedars and prickly junipel's which in a different landscape would seem inelegant al'e hal'monious and fitting. Most gmvestones me not gmvestones but the cement lids of vaults left a few inches above ground with the name of the deceased lettered on them. Once graves in such cemeteries could be found with clocks, candlesticks, or broken earthenware from the household of the deceased left to represent the end of time or light extinguished, metaphors that can be traced through the slaves of Mississippi, South Carolina, and Georgia, to the Bakongo of northern Angola.* A more common ensign today is the conch shell: life has transcended elsewhere, only the osteal remnant reminds us of its former presence. There is no contrivance or digression. Simplicity and innocence set such burial gl'ounds apart and give them the power to make us see death unencumbered by decorative illusions.   Then there are abandoned sites where natur'e is allowed to reclaim not only the bodies of the dead but their' gmves as well. Few places al'e more revel'ential. In a remote area south of Bainbridge adjoining the oldest family cemetery in the county, is a dense stand of pines beneath which lies a patchwork of graves. They extend without pattern or arrangement in shade so deep its umbra spreads over the site like a requiem. Detachment is complete. Forty foot pines. rise out of collapsed graves.   *Eugene D.

    <Transcription>OAK CITY CEMETERY: THE COUNTESS OF PAU   I was walking through Oak City Cemetery when I stumbled on the neglected grave of Marian Charlotte, Countess of Pau, Duchess of Navarre. A heraldic device was emblazoned on her heavy but simple headstone. I was intrigued. Her grave was next to that of Dr. A. E. B. Alford (1876-1948) whom I had known.   I made inquiries, but few people remembered the countess. My mother recalled her as demure. Others said she married Dr. Alford while he was a surgeon with the American Expeditionary Forces during World War I, implying a glamorous romance between a dashing army doctor and a countess. Later I tracked down Nora Greene, Dr. Alford's chief nurse who was then living in Gadsden County, Florida. She said that was nonsense. Dr. Alford met Marian Charlotte in San Francisco in 1906. They married in 1910. Near the end of the war they came to Bainbridge and built Bainbridge Hospital, which Marian Charlotte designed. They occupied an apartment on the first floor, temporary quarters until they could build a home. In 1918 she contracted Bright's Disease and died. That was all Mrs. Greene could tell me.   Dr. Alford never built the house. He lived alone in the apartment for the rest of his life. Marian Charlotte liked flowers and had begun landscaping a garden behind the hospital. Dr. Alford completed it. He brought in trees from China and Japan which were new to Bainbridge and peacocks to ornament them. He had become a well known surgeon in these parts and could have moved on to a large practice in a city, but he liked having his own hospital and running it the way he pleased. Early on summer evenings when the heat was abating, I remember seeing him in his white uniform rocking, quite alone, on the front porch of the hospital. I'd turn the corner and watch the peacocks strolling pretentiously across the lawn.   The hospital is a post-office, and the garden is a parking lot. The two headstones at the cemetery are all that is left of a scenario which insinuates much more than it tells.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>OAK CITY CEMETERY: FUNERAL 1901   Some days ago the sad intelligence reached this city that Little Muriel Gurley was quite sick with a fever at Appalachicola [sic]. Her mother, Mrs.   D. C. Gurley, had sometime previously gone there on a visit to relatives, taking the child with her. In spite of all that parential [sic] affection and medical skill could accomplish, the little sufferer continued to grow worse. Last Tuesday about noon, the anxious relatives here received a dispatch conveying the sad news of her death at nine o'clock that morning and that the remains would be brought home on the first boat...   Muriel was about six years old, a sweet and pretty child. The sad affliction that has fallen upon the parents has also brought grief and sorrow to our community.   May the Gentle Saviour give them grace sufficient   to bear them through this hour of gloom.   The Searchlight, August 17, 1901, Saturday. Volume   6, No.3.   In 1901 Bainbridge had an ordinance that prohibited bringing   the body of a person who died of scarlet fever into the city limits.   Mrs. Gurley with Muriel's body arrived on a riverboat about   seven in the morning. Mr. Gurley and friends met them and silently   escorted the body to the cemetery. Mr. Tonge, Muriel's uncle,   said he remembered how peaceful it was, only the sounds of birds:   beautiful and sad and appropriate.   In other parts of town households were waking, breakfast was   cooking, bacon frying, coffee boiling, eggs bright and yellow in   skillets, and children opening their eyes to the light of a new August   day.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE ANGEL   About twenty-five years ago I discovered a marble statue of an angel in Oak City Cemetery that had a nimbus of life about it. Its expression, especially its eyes and mouth, was like a child who had momentarily glanced down and was about to look up and say something. Its cheeks were plump and slightly flushed. Its marble skin was so tender and translucent one could almost detect veins beneath its surface. It had wings but was intensely human. It was on the grave of Sara Will Harris, a seven year old child who died of blood poisoning in 1926.   I photographed the statue for twenty-five years in various light and weather. Then I heard why there was an angel on the grave. I can't vouch for the accuracy of the story, but it was told by a distant relative of Sara's.   He said Sara lived with her mother and grandmother in a large wooden house set on high foundations. In summer, when it was hot, Sara took her dolls under the house and played in the sand. Only weeks before her death, she saw an angel. It was diminutive, like a doll, but had Sara's face. It spun around the base of the chimney several times then hung in the shadows below the floor joists and smiled. Slowly it dissolved. Sara told her mother who was busy and barely listening. After Sara died, her mother remembered and took it as word from God.   I knew nothing of this when I was drawn to the statue. Angels can be found on graves throughout the region, but most are cast in cement or plaster, not carved from such ripe marble. The statue took on a life of its own as it went from cleanliness to a state of weathered stain in which lichen and algae made rococo patterns on its face and arms. Then it would be cleaned again and the cycle would continue.   Several months ago Sara's mother, intending to protect the statue, had it coated with caustic white plaster   that entirely covered the marble, a cure far worse than the disease. The mold added a symbolic dimension and with languid growth animated it. The plaster was permanently ugly.   One recent Saturday night vandals randomly plundered Oak City Cemetery. In the moonlight the efflorescent white hid the angel's true skin and vulnerable innocence. Unable to intuit what they were destroying, the vandals took a heavy marble pot from a nearby grave and hurled it until they knocked the statue off its pedestal, breaking its head and wings, then left it lying in the grass.   Painstakingly Sara's mother retrieved the small pieces of nose and neck that had been shattered (what must have gone through her mind as she did this?) and put them in her hand bag. The local stone cutter reassembled them as best he could, but he could not save the statue's life. The scars and the caustic plaster had ravaged its poise and its quick, delicate response to light.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>AUNT GRACE   Grace is eighty-six. She is the youngest and last of my father's living siblings. She was brought up by her spinster sister, Frances, because their mother became neurotic after the accidental death of a child.   Between the wars Frances and Grace went to Germany to visit relatives. Grace met Alfred Kohnke and with the family's approval married him. They lived in Germany a year, then took family advice and came home.   Grace's brothers gave Alfred, who spoke softly but with a thick German accent and whose pastimes were playing chess and the violin, an inconspicuous job as bookkeeper in one of the family stores. They had them live with Grace's bachelor brother Ralph. Not surprisingly Grace suffered from loss of appetite, nervousness, and acute insomnia.   Albert, Grace's only child, was born in 1928 and Frances, Ralph, and Max, none of whom were married, took charge. When the real love of Albert's life, flying, was about to become a career, they manipulated him into the family business. They were afraid he might be killed in an airplane.   Grace's father, whom she idolized, died in 1934.   Frances died in 1954.   Max died in 1960.   Alfred died in 1962.   Ralph died in 1970.   Albert committed suicide in 1980.   For the first time in her life, Grace is alone. She is unattended and satisfied to be so. She has survived. She reads, listens to music, and lives in the world of her mind, which is a farrago of sharp perception and spells cast on her by the family. The couch, which she unaccountably keeps in the dining room, belonged to her father and then to Frances. It is massive; and in this photograph a metaphor for the family.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE FLINT RIVER EXPOSITION   Excitement begins in the parking lot. When you get out of your car you see the rides and hear the shrieks. By the time you get to the midway you don't know what to do first. Music is playing, people are screaming, the voices of sideshow barkers under yellow and amber lights melt into the music as though they were singing lyrics written for the occasion. No other entertainment is like the midway.   Fairs go back to a time when clowns, jugglers, and acrobats traveled over the English and European countryside entertaining peasants at community bazaars. The Flint River Exposition in Decatur County is like that.   The midways that come to Bainbridge play mid-western fairs during the summer, southern fairs during the fall, and go to Florida for the winter. By the time they reach Bainbridge, fatigue and boredom have set in. The roustabouts are suspicious or defensive and shield themselves with either bravado or sullennes. The owners are not much better: most are jaded and feel themselves harassed.   The rides don't change much. The ferris wheel and merry-go-round never change; the Octopus, the Tilt-A-Whirl, and the swings have been around in their present form for two generations. The growth of passive entertainment, television, movies, and spectator sports, doesn't seem to have hurt attendance on the midway. The mesmeric music and neon, rides that frighten but are harmless, and side shows that are not even good fakery, continue to appeal to human nature which has always rebelled at too much refinement.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>DECATUR COUNTY FARMS     The first Decatur County farmers (1823) lead an isolated existence in a remote corner of a sparsely settled state. Their methods were primitive, and they had no reserves to fall back on in the event of a crop failure. Their dependence on land and climate made their day-to-day survival uncertain.   Statistics of Georgia, published in 1849, by Rev. George White sets the slave population of Decatur County at three thousand six hundred thirty-nine. Since Decatur County was almost entirely agricultural, it is reasonable to assume that most slaves worked on farms. The chief marketable crop was cotton.   Despite a century of great scientific and cultural changes, farms in the south did not feel the effects of new technology and adequate credit until after World War II. Into the nineteen forties farming maintained an archaic man-earth relationship. The farmer, without assistance from anyone but nature, called forth food from a bare field. He knew from bitter experience that his crops depended, not only on hard work and intelligence, but on chance and that nature might undo him with the ease and cruelty of a tyrant. Generations of farmers subjected to this uncertainty developed a set of characteristics: sobriety, frugality, and independence. Not formally well educated but conditioned by the exigencies of nature, they developed a practical imagination and an astonishing capacity to improvise.   After World War II communications, technology, and credit altered what people, including farmers, wanted out of life. To be born, grow up, marry, and raise a family was not enough. One's life had to be significant and expressive. It had to retain a certain status and bear the stamp of a culturally acceptable discipline: medicine, law, politics, etc. Unfortunately farming, aside from being difficult, lacked prestige. Collaterally the media, for which the average citizen had more time, was spreading the idea that every life had its own drama and everyone in his own way was a hero.   However revolutionary changes were taking place on the farm. Most were brought about by circumstances indirectly related to the war: breakthroughs in biology, chemistry, and farm machinery, and the necessity of feeding a large part of a devastated world. The value of land soared and the need for higher production per acre made good management and a rigid budget as necessary to the farm as it was to the factory. Farmers had to negotiate favorable loans, inform themselves of new techniques, keep abreast of government programs, which frequently changed with the party in power, and constantly watch markets and events around the world. In every sense farming had become a profession, and those who could not make the transition from the old ways confirmed that they were not fit to perform this essential function for the modern world.   Today's farmer is living in a country dominated by urban frames of reference. The majority of Americans know nothing about farming. A New Yorker with business in San Francisco flies the continent, deplanes, attends to his business, and returns without ever having left the metropolitan areas or seen anything of the land between. Encapsulated at thirty thousand feet, he is exposed to neither the land nor the people who feed him.   In the nineteenth century when cities began to coalesce, attracting labor from the surrounding countryside, transplants knew first-hand what rural life was like. In the early years of this century they still maintained connections with home. But today urban dwellers are several generations removed. They get their impressions of rural life second hand from the news or entertainment media both of whom are preoccupied with speed and profit, not accuracy. This handicaps farmers who need the urban population for political support and an appreciation of the complexity of their problems.   Changes on farms, in Decatur County and elsewhere, are unpredictable. When Rev. White published his statistics cotton was the important crop. Since then it has been corn, peanuts, livestock, and recently truck crops. Now cotton is coming back. For the first time in fifty years a cotton gin is operating in Decatur County. Of course the cotton bears little resemblance to that grown in 1849. It is better cotton, longer stranded and disease resistant; planted, dusted, sprayed, and picked by machine, and there will be more bales per acre. Techniques improve, strains get hardier, and the land and climate are not the hazard they used to be. But still there is the threat of extinction. The blessings of science have been offset by the curse of an inscrutable economy and the farmer's painful numerical inferiority,   which excludes him from the mainstream of national conscious  ness.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>PORTRAITS: DR. MORTIMER EHRLICH     Like many physicians who lack self-assurance, Dr. Morty Ehrlich sometimes overstated his eminence, and did not have a warm bedside manner. He was born in Bainbridge in 1893. He and his brother, Sigo, practiced together until Sigo's death in 1936.   On Dr. Ehrlich's eighty-fifth birthday, I was asked to take a picture of him. His office, which predated the first hospital in Bainbridge, had an operating room. Although it had been forty years since the last surgery was performed there, it was fully equipped and ready for the next patient.   While I set up the camera facing the operating table, he reminisced aloud about what had gone on in this room, finally coming to rest on his favorite case, a girl in her twenties who fell from a horse and was brought in unconscious. She had extensive head injuries, the most urgent of which was a subdural hematoma. Unless pressure inside her skull were relieved she would die. There was no neurosurgeon south of Macon, and there was not time to move her. Sigo, the spokesman for the pair, explained this to her family and got their consent to do what they could.   They took two volumes on surgery of the head to the operating room. Sigo operated and Morty read: then Morty operated and Sigo read. They drilled holes in the skull and removed a section. They worked past blood vessels to the dura matter. The clot could not be removed. They stanched the bleeding, but the brain had blood on it and was beginning to swell. They suctioned, then decided that with no more training and equipment it would be safer to stop. They closed and put the patient in a little room off the operating room where Morty and Sigo took turns pulling her through one crisis after another. To their surprise she lived to be transferred; the neurosurgeon in Macon praised their handling of the case.   Morty was proud. This case was his moment of glory. A few years later Sigo died of cancer, and the practice shrank to insurance examinations, company physicals, and obstetrics.   I knew from the taut way he told the story, stripping it to its essentials, using enough medical terms to give it authority and make it conVincing, that he had told it often and with concern for its effect. Drama is like seasoning: a little goes in when the dish is cooked. The rest is added when it's served.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>PORTRAITS: REEDA MAE JACKSON   Reeda Mae Jackson came to work for my mother from a farm outside Iron City when she was eighteen. Her husband had been killed (World War I) just months after they married. She was five feet of sinew and self-confidence. The self-confidence was warranted: her mania for work was like that of a starving man for food.   In the afternoons when Reeda had finished her cleaning, she often took me to the Atlantic Coastline depot four blocks away where we sat on a Railway Express freight cart and watched the trains go by. Steam engines literally pounded the rails, and if you were as close to the tracks as Reeda and I and the train barely slowed for the station, the ground shook and cinders and coal dust filled the air. Reeda knew the number and destination of every freight and passenger train, and was enchanted by the fact that tomorrow the train would be at a remote terminus. Looking back I can see that she already had the wanderlust, and these trips to the depot were, to her, clandestine. We did more than watch trains; we shared fantasies.   Reeda's house was on the edge of a ghetto called the Pear Orchard, just across the tracks. Sometimes we went there for refreshments or to wash the coal dust off before I went home. I was the honored guest. I had Reeda's undivided attention. She showed me a rocking chair that had belonged to her great uncle and a broken figurine my mother had given her. She always had a dog and often puppies for me to play with.   When I was eight, with little notice, Reeda left for New Jersey. To me it was like a death. I heard my mother   and father say they thought her impulsive. They said she   would be back. But they underestimated her. Years later,   when the world had changed much more than Reeda, I under  stood that she could not have survived in Georgia. She   must have considered her alternatives carefully   for it was risky in 1936 to leave a good job.     Reeda worked in Wildwood, New Jersey during the summers, then went to Miami to work during the winters. She saved and bought property, and each year she had a little more. But she continued working, because work, not money, was essential. She was not a person to offer advice, but Reeda's influence was inevitable. As I watched she solved her problems with the simplest of means: patience and work.   She came to Bainbridge at least once a year, partly to see my brother and me. The photograph was taken in her living room in Bainbridge on her next-to-last visit. She was almost ninety.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>PORTRAITS: MARIE DIXON   Marie's power to make herself appear as a righter of wrongs while at the same time maintaining endearing humility made me think of martyrs, which in turn reminded me vaguely of saints. She often said that the battle is more important than the outcome, which is the ethos of a martyr.   She attended college during the early 1920s when few blacks and fewer black women got college educations. Her subject was English but she taught also that a black woman could be intelligent and independent. She was proud: of herself, of her mother and father, and particularly of having found early what she had no doubt was the truth.   Marie, a woman marked by passion, believed passionately in Jesus Christ ---&quot;There is nothing wrong with people,&quot; she said one day, lilt's hate that causes all the trouble&quot; ---and in the literal truth of the Bible. For her, conflict was a religious dilemma. &quot;You have to turn yourself over to Jesus, and get all that hate out of your heart,II she said. &quot;0nly then are you ready for the golden rule.&quot; She didn't say this glibly or sanctimoniously. For example she said, &quot;l don't hate white people. No. There's good white people and bad black people. It's not color, it's what kind of person you are. If you're hate filled,&quot; she made it sound like hateful, &quot;you're bad, black or white.&quot; Nor did she condemn the south collectively for its abuse of blacks. &quot;Not all southerners wanted to keep blacks down,&quot; she said, observing instinctively the complexity of the problem. She wanted dignity for her people, and that, she thought, was largely a state of mind. The biggest problem, according to. Marie, was convincing young blacks to get an education.   She was a vivid woman who brought her intensity and creativity to her career, for which her students loved her. They dubbed her Mumsie Dear. The moniker, like those given sports heroes, took note of only one characteristic. She was matronly, she smiled a lot, and her talk was often mellifluous, but she was no Mumsie Dear. There was much more to her than that. She could be charming and combative in the same sentence. She knew how to stand her ground; she had a sure sense for the tactic that would work; and she was relentless. She was Georgia's first Teacher of the Year and was inducted into Albany State College's (her alma mater) Hall of Fame. More honors followed.   I went to see her in the nursing home shortly before her death. It was a depressing place, and she knew she was dying. She was dictating to a tape recorder her autobiography, on which she had worked sporadically for several years and was oblivious to the environment. Obviously she would not complete it, yet we discussed the problems of writing autobiography as if we were sitting around her dining room table where stle usually wrote. Death was nowhere to be seen. When I stood up to go sne looked around the room and saw it. The many cards and flowers from friends could not warm tne chill. Sne signed and said, &quot;Sometimes the battle is more important tll~d l&quot;e ';'UlC;;,~,C.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>PORTRAITS: A MAN SITTING IN HIS YARD   For years I drove past a stand of pines about a mile south of Fowlstown without knowing that a house and small farm were behind them. Then one day I noticed a column of smoke and automobile ruts. I turned off the highway and followed the ruts, which ran into a clearing where there was a big, weathered house with smoke rising from a chimney, a small barn, a yard, and a field ready for planting. The ruts broadened out into a driveway along which ran a delicate, in some ways beautiful, fence built of stripped saplings and branches. Under a large oak tree were Jerusalem Cherries in containers made from truck tires painted white. The sidewalls of the tires had been turned out and cut in a saw tooth pattern. Suddenly I realized a man was sitting in a chair by the fence.   He startled me because I had not noticed him, and he had not spoken. He just sat there seemingly lost in in his own thought. Even when I started toward him he didn1t move or look my way. His clothes were ragged and worn but freshly laundered and the way they encompassed him made me sense his lean body underneath. I introduced myself. He said nothing. I asked about the house which was dark and silent. He said it was a hundred years old and a good house, but he didn't own it. He rented it and the small farm on shares. He stared at the house while I waited expectantly. Finally I asked if I could take his picture. He said yes. As I photographed I studied his face, especially his eyes, for a clue to his strange composure. When I finished he was still looking toward the house. I thanked him and said goodbye.   As I drove out of the clearing and back down the ruts to the highway I was bewildered by this quiescent man. He was certainly an extension of the concealed farm and the dark house, and surely it was he who made the fence and turned the old truck tires to flower pots.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>FACTORY WORKERS     Many jobs require extensive editing of self. An employer buys only that part of a person which is needed for a specific job, and he views the remainder as a liability: he doesn't want it on the premises.   Elberta Crate &amp; Box Co. makes wirebound containers for the fruit and vegetable industries and Kraveneer for disposable wood palettes.   They have a fifteen minute break in the morning and another in the afternoon. They have thirty minutes for lunch, which is spent talking and laughing over a drink or candy bar from a vending machine or coffee and a sandwich brought from home. The women get together in small groups, then the men join them for talk and flirtations.   I spoke with a foreman who was eating his lunch alone. He had been with the company many years and talked about his impending retirement. His children were married. His wife was dead. When he took the job he thought it was temporary. He had ambitions once to be on his own, but they got lost in a scramble of responsibilities, and he was sorry. He took off his cap and wiped his forehead with his handkerchief, then wiped the band inside the cap. His voice took on a tone of confidentiality. He could have done more, he said, but at the time he took the job he just wanted to get married and make a living: eight hours devoted to paying for the other sixteen.   When the whistle blew and the lunch break was over, every individual became an employee again, using only that part of himself that was useful in the production of crates and Kraveneer: running a saw, a conveyor, a dryer, or a fork lift.   I overheard a beautiful woman of about forty telling her friend that her clock failed to go off and she was almost late. She said she grabbed a quick shower and left her bed unmade. I pictured her rooms: the crumpled sheets, water dripping from the showerhead, a bar of soap melting in the soap dish, and the wonderful smell of a fresh scrubbed woman settling over the place. She had left her essence behind in her carapace: what I saw in the factory was merely the little organism that lived inside, and she would become whole again at five o'clock.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>FACTORY WORKERS: HORACE BATTLES. THE MAN WHO BLEW THE WHISTLE   When I was a boy I liked to lie in bed with the windows open listening to sounds late at night and early in the morning. At night I heard couples strolling home after the last show at the Ritz. Their steps and their conversations were usually at the same tempo, sometimes animated, sometimes intimate.   At daybreak I listened for two things. The first was the Whigham Dairy truck which made a gritty sound as its wheels turned off unpaved Monroe onto the concrete of Broughton. Two boys with wire baskets containing milk, cream, and butter jumped off the back and ran thudding across the front yard, bottles clanking. They put our order on the front steps.   The other thing I listened for was the Elberta Crate Co. whistle. On the second stroke of six from the city clock, it blew three long wails to tell workers on the first shift they had an hour before work. Most lived in the Pear Orchard, Battle's Quarters, or Bishop's bottom where little was stirring except a few restless dogs. But the whistle got things going and soon lamps were lit, privy doors creaked, and a radio or two were turned on.   The man who blew the whistle was Horace Battles. In 1981 when I was photographing at Elberta I ran into him. His principal job was looking after the boilers but he still blew the whistle too. I asked him if I could take his picture in front of a big. monogramed boiler door. He was annoyed at the interruption but he left the conveyer belt he was aligning and did as I asked. I was tempted to tell him how I waited for the whistle ---so intently I could tell when some one else was blowing it. He hit it precisely on the second stroke of six o'clock: his deputy was not that exact. But the noise and chaos of the boiler shed made conversation difficult. Suddenly I was discouraged by his crusty dignity from saying anything. The picture was made, and the moment passed.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>RURAL BLACK CHURCHES   The God who is worshipped in St. Peters in Rome is vain, bombastic, and ostentatious. The God who is worshipped in Moses Chapel, Mt. Horum, Pilgrim Rest, or Mt. Zuma in Decatur County is a no-nonsense father who loves his children impartially, even the most despised of men.   Most black rural churches were old the day they were finished. Their materials were begged or bought second hand. Windows and doors often came from several buildings and varied in size. The panes of glass were painted to imitate stained glass and fill the sanctuary with warmth and color. Pews were made out of the stoutest cast-off boards that could be found. Whatever else the building lacked, there was always a steeple. It might be only a small wooden box straddling the hip of the roof, but its symbolism was recognized by all. Two privys stood in the woods behind the church. Baptism was performed at the river or in a nearby lake or stream.   As a place to worship, these houses of God were far more solemn and sacred than edifices erected by larger urban churches, black or white. Poverty made the congregations zealous. The simplicity forced on them by hardships gave in return economy of style, clarity of purpose, and a virility found only in churches built by people whose survival depended on keeping their spirits alive.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>MT. ZION CHURCH WITH SUNDA Y SCHOOL CLASS ON STEPS   It is hot and still. Clouds as high as mountains hang over the landscape. The humidity is oppressive. In a clearing behind dark woods leans an old whitewashed clapboard church in the shape of an oblong box. It looks thoroughly exhausted and compliant. Both front doors hang open. The preacher's voice floats into the church yard and cemetery which has been cut out of the surrounding woods like a hole left in dough by a biscuit cutter.   This is Mt. Zion African Methodist Episcopal Church five miles south of Bainbridge. It is typical of rural congregations whose membership once lived on nearby farms. The farms are planted in pine trees now and their tenants, most of them laid to rest in the hot south Georgia ground, have passed into the widely censured but poorly understood history of the agrarian south.   I went there to photograph the building. It was mostly age: the siding split, the paint gone with rain and sun, doors sagging, windows propped open. That the place still existed was improbable enough, but what the preacher was teaching the children in Sunday School was a contradiction of the black message for the last thirty years: that God who was gentle at heart would reward injury and humiliation in this life with happiness and leisure in the life to come.   Had the old church conjured this preacher up from the days of its youth? His lesson was as decrepit and hoary as the building and could have been delivered there on any Sunday morning during the twenties and thirties.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>MOUNT HORUM INTERIOR   I went to Mt. Horum Church often, but it was always locked. I left a note asking some one to let me know when services were held, but there was no reply.   The building was ramshackled. I could look through large cracks in the doors and see handmade pews, white sheets draped across the pulpit and altar rail, and hymn books and fans that changed positions from one time to the other, proving that people had been there.   On Christmas afternoon 1977, my daughter Susan and I decided to go to Mt. Horum on the chance that a service might be going on. The weather was cold and the sky clear. The church was locked, but we found a window partly open. We lifted the sash and climbed inside.   Light poured in through every chink and crack, and as it passed through the glass of those skewed, disintegrating windows it was transformed by the whitewashed walls and pews into benign warmth. The front doors, held shut with rusty chain, struggled to hold back raw light which, had it come pouring in, looked hot enough to scald us. It was as if God in his radiance stood in the church yard.   Neither Susan nor I moved for some time. When we did, it was reverently to absorb and hold what we could. This was God's house and we had found Him at home.   Mount Horum is located about a mile and a half northeast of Climax.  </Transcription>

Weeds, even trees, have grown up and surrounded it so densely the structure can't be seen from the road. Oddly, the furnishings inside remain as they were for the last service, as though the congregation walked out and for whatever reason never returned. I photographed the interior one last time and was surprised to see that despite the broken windows, the leaking   roof, an open door, it had changed surprisingly little. It is still a reverence inspiring sanctuary. Its neglect and isolation radiate sacredness.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE OLD PREACHER AT THE FIRST AFRICAN   BAPTIST CHURCH OF CAMILLA BAPTIZING   THE CHILDREN     I responded immediately to this old man. He had been a preacher for fifty-five years and would soon retire.   There were many young people to be baptized and his remarks were addressed to them. He said he had tried to do God's work and resist temptation. There were times when he thought he was missing a lot, but now that he was old he could see both ways: backward over his life and forward to a life hereafter. He was glad he had stuck to his duty. &quot;You have your lives ahead of you and your choices, and I can't tell you how to make them,&quot; he said. &quot;I just hope when you get my age you're satisfied because there's no doing it over.&quot;   It was honest talk from a preacher. He looked a little feeble, but when he got in the baptismal pool it was like a fountain of youth. His vigor returned, and he baptized like there was no tomorrow.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>MT. ZUMA'S NEW POOL   April 1982, a perfect spring day, brilliant sun, dry crisp air.   When I arrived at Mt. Zuma, I found Rev. Mitchell and his son impatiently watching the new baptismal pool fill with water from a garden hose. Rev. Mitchell shook my hand and explained that the new pool was constructed entirely by members of the congregation. Behind Rev. Mitchell stood the concrete block Mt. Zuma church building, blindingly white and the clone of a dozen other churches in Decatur County. In the last thirty years they have replaced the flimsy, improvised wooden churches, so obviously built of love and little else. Rev. Mitchell said there would be no more baptisms at the river: it was too public and old-fashioned.   People began arriVing. The women wore dark dresses and hats, the men suits, gold jewelry, and heavy lotions. The children had on their starched white Sunday clothes.   After the invocation Rev. Mitchell announced that following the baptism the service would move indoors.   The first candidate for baptism was a girl of fifteen. She wore a nightgown under a chenille bathrobe and a towel around her hair. With some embarrassment she removed the robe and entered the water, her head down, her eyes avoiding every spectator. Rev. Mitchell and Ben Edwards took her by the arms and placed her between them. Rev. Mitchell prayed, then quickly immersed her. She came up dazed, trying to get her bearings. Water ran out of her nose and mouth ---every drop had its own sun ---and down her dark skin. The nylon nightgown clung sensuously to her. Even the humble water that had come tediously from the garden hose had points of light flashing across its surface.   The girl was met by her mother holding a robe. The next candidate entered the pool. There were five in all. When the last child was out, Rev. Mitchell said a prayer and everyone went inside.   Now the church yard was empty. The surface of the water was still. Footprints in the sand was all that remained of the crowd. In the sanctuary they were singing. I studied the pool and the blue sky that was visible in it and wondered by what miracle they were able to make such an insipid place into something radiant and mysterious for this occasion.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>DECATUR COUNTY COURTHOUSE   The first courthouse in Decatur County (1823) was a small log cabin not far from the Flint River. Shortly after it was completed and the first session of court was held, a group of irate citizens, protesting a verdict they didn't like, took it down log by log and threw it in the river. Next morning there was only a vacant lot where the new courthouse had stood.   The location of the second courthouse is uncertain, but is believed to have been Willis Park. Apparently it lasted only fourteen years and was replaced for unknown reasons by a third structure which remained until the present fourth courthouse was occupied in 1903.   A court house is a peculiar place. In it one gives up individuality and becomes a statistic: a tax payer, a voter, a juror, or a number in a census.   FOUND NEGRO SWINGING TO LIMB   Passersby on the River Road were surprised Wednesday morning to find a Negro named Schuler hanging to a limb on a tree about five miles from the city. Shuler [sic] has attempted rape on a young white girl in that section and paid the usual penalty. The work was done it seems very quietly and without any excitement. In fact much more orderly than either Ohio or Massechusettets [sic]. The body was taken down Wednesday and an inquest held and the incident closed. The matter was talked of a little on the streets of Bainbridge, but there seemed to be nothing undue about the discussion.   Post-Searchlight: Thursday, September 28, 1916.   This event and others like it were eruptions of the same temperament that caused the first courthouse to be razed. Excitable citizens in remote, isolated areas like Decatur County were suspicious of courts and legislatures. They mistrusted their power and resented interference in their lives. Their extreme poverty and ignorance   engendered a frontier morale. For those whose feelings   of impotence made their rage violent, the law, when it   acted at all, did not act swiftly or severely enough.   LYNCHING WILL OCCUR   Much is being said and nothing being done about so-called mob law that prevails in Georgia. It is deplorable but there is no need of our papers playing hypocrites over the matter for they well know that they do not regret to see any man lynched for rape and there is not any use of throwing any fits about it. They don't fool anyone by their frantic holy-horror attitude. We are law abiding, we want to be law abiding but we are human first and when a woman is worse than lynched we are sorry to hear of it but disappointed sadly if the brute that did the deed is not swung to the first tree they get him to after he is identified by the woman and they are sure they have the right man. Atter [sic] a woman has suffered this horrible experience it is nothing but common humanity to relieve her of having to go into court into a courthouse and go through a second raping in the presence of a bunch of gaping curiosity seekers, tell the awful story and be questioned by lawyers about the terrible occurrence. Our papers rant and rave about the majesty of the law being trampled under feet when every man in that community knows that the editor that wrote the article would join his neighbors in a manhunt in a moment when some of the ladies of that city or community has been treated thus. It is all bosh to try to make lefthanded apologies to the outside world for a matter that bears on a certain community alone. We deplore lynching, but not near as much as we loath the thought of a good woman being murdered in this manner. There is and has never been any color line in lynching a man for the raping of a woman and there never will be. Papers can preach all they want to, but when a woman is raped in this country by a man be he white, black, yellow, or green, he will dangle at the end of a rope and this can no more be stopped than can a lepord [sic] change his spots. These holy-horror preachments on the subject do more harm than good. But to lynch a man for any other crime is a terrible thing and all men are saddened to hear of it but few of us ever know the local conditions that brought   about such a deed. While these local conditions could not warrant the act they will in a measure condone it.   Bainbridge Post-Searchlight, February 3, 1916. Editorial page.   The last mob violence in Decatur County took place as late as 1936. A black man working in turpentine raped and stabbed to death with a hack-sharpener two white women. He escaped to Dothan, Alabama, but was caught hiding in an attic. Our sheriff sent four deputies to bring him back. On the return, just inside Decatur County where the deputies were sovereign, the prisoner tried to escape, it was said, and had to be shot. His body was taken to Torn Bynes' Funeral Horne. A mob grabbed it, drug it around the square--the lady in the box-office at the Ritz never forgot--then took it to the Negro ballpark on Webster Street and strung it up over a bonfire. The deputy who proudly owned up to having shot the prisoner was elected sheriff a few years later.   Until it was remodeled recently, the courthouse smelled of cigar butts and stale spittoons. The few women who worked in it were miserable and cranky. A decaying Confederate flag, the first to fly over the state capital at Milledgeville, hung in the jury room.   Into this environment citizens carne to pay taxes, buy license plates, record deeds, and serve on juries. In the courtroom whites sat downstairs, blacks in the balcony (none in the jury box). By 1978, when the courthouse required a complete renovation to comply with state fire codes, major changes had occurred. The supreme court had struck down segregation and reassessed the fairness with which laws were applied by judges, commissions, and boards of education. Most important, voter registration had made blacks a political force. The time had corne to make the courthouse less menacing. The balcony was removed from the courtroom, ceilings were lowered, floors carpeted,   and rest rooms integrated.   Segregation which is based on the theory of white supremacy, had a long and virulent history in Decatur County, and the courthouse was its backbone. But ten years after the supreme court's rulings against segregation and the enfranchising of a large percentage of the black population, the abuse was diminished though not erased. The people of Decatur County have corne a long ways since the night they tore down the courthouse because they didn't like a verdict. The transformation was painfully slow and hardly voluntary or complete, but what there was was effected peacefully and with less disruption than was expected. The few objections though bellicose, were feeble. The public was glad to bury a rank corpse that had become a political and economic millstone.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>NIGHT BAPTISM, MT. ZUMA, FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1991   The last night of a revival is the traditional time for baptizing. Rev.

ZUMA, FRIDAY, APRIL 19, 1991   The last night of a revival is the traditional time for baptizing. Rev. Mitchell told me to be there by nine, but I was there by eighty-thirty. I stood in the vestibule a few minutes debating whether or not to go into the sanctuary. Rev. Mitchell wouldn't have minded, but my presence, especially with the camera, would be distracting to the congregation and to the visiting evangelist who was far enough along in his sermon to be shouting and sweating and vulnerable. So I waited outside, making frequent trips back to look through the crack in the swinging doors. The sanctuary was bright and packed. The warmth of so many bodies and the blending of so many cosmetics in such a small a space spilled out into the vestibule where I stood. Finally I walked outside.   It had been a rainy afternoon, but the temperature had dropped and the clouds were gone. A quarter moon and a few stars were out. The baptismal pool was half full. I could hear the evangelist firing questions at the congregation, and they were answering with practiced animation. When at last he finished, there was relative quiet except for some shuffling as the crowd repositioned itself. Rev. Mitchell said something I couldn't make out, and the whole tenor of the proceedings changed from extravagant to simple and from gesticulatory to sublime.   Out of this bare, arid structure came ~ capella music: mournful, to be sung on the saddest day of one's life, better keened than sung. The exaggerated legato made words indistinct, but the message was in the music and was addressed to one who wouldn't need words. What an enormous taproot of suffering was in the sound.   Later, seeing the photographs I was reminded that when our inner needs demand, our senses are circumvented, and seeing is not believing, which accounts for a mildew stained, concrete block pool becoming a sacred vessel of salvation.   The pictures tell me that beatific rituals have very little to do with the spirit. The spirit listens to itself. It survives on internal nourishment which can be quite heady, as these pictures demonstrate. They were made by flash which imparts a harsh, turbulent aspect, overwhelming the faint light by which those of us who were there witnessed the event. They are not what we saw. They are an alternative interpretation, but in some ways more accurate and pregnant than an eye witness account.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>BLACK PENTACOSTALS   The tradition of spontaneous frenzy is such a part of the black birthright that there is no visible seam between sacred and secular. The expression of it ---singing, shouting, strutting, jumping, and dancing ---is the same, whether in a bar or disco on Saturday night, or in church on Sunday morning.   It appears during the invocation. Collecting his words into phrases like music, the preacher sets the prayer to a beat. Slowly, without his audience noticing, he quickens the tempo and by sheer stagecraft makes his sincerity palpable. He is nearly airborne, transported to the brink of ecstasy and neither sees nor hears the congregation. His message is no longer in the meaning of the words. It is in the rhythm and modulations of his voice which are now carefully shaped. It is close to scat-singing. He moves in long, spastic strides around the pulpit, arms raised, head back, eyes upward. His body begins to shake, sweat rolls down his face, and he shouts, &quot;It's coming! It's coming! I can't hold it back!&quot; Arms spread, he becomes rigid and starts to tremble, his legs twitch, he bends at the hips, and suddenly his eyes glaze and he is speechless.   His momentum hangs suspended, and the choir, as if to the rescue, takes over. They imprOVise, each member singing or shouting her own musical supplication. The effect is dissonant and vehement. The congregation dances; first at their seats, then in the isles, and finally all over the church. The singing gets louder and the dancing more strenuous. A twelve year old boy is on drums, a fourteen year old girl plays piano, and a twenty year old mechanic from KMart turns up his electric guitar.   A woman screams and falls back, her skirt up to her thighs. Quickly   another woman pulls it down. Some one clears a space in the center of the   crowd and does a flashy solo step. The others, still dancing and shouting, clap   and watch. Individuals move in and out of the circle strutting and sweating,   determined to climb the mountain. If they can't drop from ecstasy, they'll   drop from exhaustion. This lasts until there are too few left standing to sustain   the mood. Then the preacher goes behind the pulpit and signals the musicians to stop.   The sudden quiet is dramatic. The air in the church takes a while to settle. The congregants wipe perspiration and straighten their clothes. After a long, contrived wait, the preacher begins his sermon. His voice is sober. He lectures the congregation sternly and with conventional admonitions for an hour-and-a-half. Then he makes announcements and gives the benediction.   The first services I attended overwhelmed me. They seemed ear-splitting and crude. Sexuality so near the surface was disquieting. But when I saw others and was able to observe them with more detachment, I realized that spontaneity was the key. The standard of comparison, traditional Christian ritual, is inappropriate, for spontaneity can be as reverential as solemnity. The form it takes, singing and dancing, is merely part of an inheritance.   The orthodox concept is that God is king and man is subject. The black pentacostals see God as father and man as child. A king is feared: a father is trusted.   It is appropriate for people whose muscle and stoutheartedness have brought them through the fires of history to use their bodies as well as their minds and voices for worship.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>MT. ZUMA BAPTISM IN FLINT RIVER BOAT BASIN   It was Sunday morning in late April 1977, and as usual I arrived early. But soon the bus bearing the Sunday School carne and after that several cars of families. Ben Edwards, a deacon and driver of the bus, got out and carne over. He said Rev. Mitchell would be late that his nineteen year old son just died. I asked what happened. Ben didn't know. He said it was very sudden, but Rev. Mitchell had assured him he would perform the baptism.   When Rev. Mitchell arrived only a few minutes late, I explained to him I had wanted to take pictures but under the circumstances I'd do it another time. He said I was welcome to take all the pictures I wanted.   Three children were to be baptized, two girls and a boy. We moved down by the water and Rev. Mitchell lead the group in a hymn. The voices were ardent but absorbed into the flat landscape and the Sunday stillness. Then Rev. Mitchell preached. He began slowly, with uncertainty, but as he went on he got his bearings and his voice grew stronger. He was utterly gripped by what he was saying, and I couldn't help observing that his concentration--stalwart remedy that it is--had made him forget for a moment what had happened.   After the preaching he and Ben and another man whose name I didn't know, walked into the water. The first candidate entered, afraid but submissive. Rev. Mitchell raised his arm and prayed, then he and Ben Edwards laid the child back and brought her up again. Holding her tightly by the arms, Ben and the other man walked her to the water's edge where they exchanged her for the next candidate.   Afterwards I walked over to Rev. Mitchell who was talking to the parents of the children. I told him how impressive he was, how confident he seemed. He looked at me quite matterof-factly as though I were a student in his Sunday School class, and said that his son was loaned to him, not given.   Now God wanted him and he was in a better place. He would miss him, but he would see him again some day. Grief was not absent, just circumvented.   This was not lip service to his ministry. I saw Rev. Mitchell's eyes. This was faith assimilated, refined and tested.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>THE WORLD OF LAURA POPE   That death gives war both its terror and romance has long been the subject of plays and novels. But I had never seen it put forward in sculpture until I saw the remnants of the Laura Pope Museum six or seven miles north of Cairo in Grady County, just east of Decatur County.   Mrs. Pope, who died in the mid-fifties, lived on a farm and seemed to be an ordinary housewife until something within her released a compulsion to create. Whether its appearance merely coincided with World War I or whether it was brought on by the war, it erupted with a profusion of life-size statues of soldiers and nurses. Mrs. Pope had no formal training for the job she undertook. She apparently cast the faces in cement from life masks which she obtained from family and friends. The core of the bodies was filled with whatever material was at hand: brickbats, iron bars, chunks of cement, even broken glass. The outside obviously presented a greater problem. It could not be cast from life moulds, and she was incapable of sculpting realistically, which pointed her in the direction of a stylized rendering, a brilliant, but I suspect gratuitous solution. An officer stands rigidly at attention, his military collar garrot-like around his neck. He is the incarnation of a nightmare, an archetypal warrior. He has the face of a man and the body of a toy soldier. His cement chest breathes war. Nearby a grief stricken wraith, a feminine face set on ribbons of cement, rises out of a bed of rocks. Always the theme is compellingly sexual: gladiatorial males, restorative females. At one time there were over a hundred and fifty such sculptures in the yard.   Mrs. Pope constructed a wall between yard and highway and topped it with busts of nurses and soldiers. Then she decorated the exterior of the house with iron frames of sewing machines, wagon and bicycle wheels, and bric-abrac of all kinds. Inside she painted murals depicting castles in dark, brooding landscapes and wrote a brief gothic tale to go with each one.   Only a small fraction of her work survives. Years of winter rains soaked and froze the statues, and they crumbled. After Mrs. Pope's death a son made a museum out of the house and grounds and charged admission. Then it was sold to its present owner, a farmer, who faces a dilemma: what to do with the junk in his front yard.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>FOREWORD   Standing in willis Park and confronting any side of the square it is easy to remember Bainbridge as it was fifty years ago. Asphalt streets fade into rough brick paving, stores change; there are islands of quietness where you can hear birds in the park and voices. Mr. Brady in his dry goods store expertly measures cloth from a bolt by holding it along his extended left arm, drawing the cloth to the tip of his nose with his right hand and repeating as often as necessary. Mr. Haddon stands in the open doorway of Haddon's Department Store watching the delivery boy at Ehrlich Drug Co. across the street repair a link in his bicycle chain. He turns around and proudly surveys his store, the only store in town with a mezzanine, on which he intends to display toys at Christmas. Mrs. Maddox and one of the Mrs. Bowers, wearing similar dark prints with hems at the calf, are talking in front of the A &amp; P while two bag boys load their groceries. Maybelle Hawes and Willie Mae Howell are having curb service at Overstreet Drug Co. on the other side of Willis Park. Four blocks away at Riverside Hospital Dr. Gordon Chason and Dr. R.F. Wheat are trying to get a patient whose appendix they took out earlier to stop moaning and crying for help. The hospital smells of ether and alcohol. Hodges, the obese head nurse, who, in spite of her severe haircut and masculine demeanor is pretty when she   laughs, puts a hypodermic needle into the man's upper arm. The hospital walls are bare and the patient's moans bounce off the ceramic tile wainscotting in the long hallway echoing and amplifying alarmingly. On the other side of town windows are open in all the classrooms of the grammar school. They are tall heavy windows with Thanksgiving turkeys cut out of yellow and orange construction paper stuck to the panes. Several yellow jackets float lazily in and out of the rooms through the open windows. Occasionally one will drift close to the head of one of the children and cause a commotion.   The children are hot and flatulent and even with the windows open the air is stale. A person walking by on Potter Street could hear, if they listened, the voice of each teacher.   The voices have died away. Time propels us headlong and memory is our only grip on the past. Every fall with the first frost I become nostalgic. I remember certain things from my childhood. I remember vividly Broughton Street as seen from my bicycle with wind blowing in my eyes and the frigid air bringing tears. It causes me to experience, not what I felt then, but sentiment fashioned out of the distance between then and now. Sadly the reality itself has been swallowed by time, and that realization is like looking down in the split second before his jaws close, and seeing both your legs in a shark's mouth. The present becomes the past before we can see ourselves standing in it. If it weren't for memory we'd have nothing. Memory, like a choice cut from the flank of reality, affords life what continuity it has and makes us what we are ---human beings. Photography has become an indispensible part of society's memory.   People ask why I spend my life documenting a simple place like Decatur County. They confuse simple with small. There are no simple places or simple lives. The problems Decatur Countians face may be unlike the problems of urban life, but they are no less threatening and therefore exacting. Fulfillment and self-respect are as necessary but elusive here as elsewhere.   Having been born and raised in Decatur County, I know it like I know myself. Its understated landscape and prosaic s~ructures comfort me with their familiarity, like a mother suckling her child. It is the first bit of the world my new eyes saw and later I learned to feel secure in its familiarity. The places where we spend our childhood and adolescence do much to set the tone of our subsequent lives. For that and other reasons it is important to know the institutions, the history, the economy, even the buildings and the landscape--insofar as they determined the lives of forebears  -as parameters within which we develop.   Decatur County, like all places, was shaped by history and geography. For almost a century after its establishment in 1823, it was isolated and sparsely settled. Decatur Countian's dependence on land and climate for a meagre livelihood made them practical people. The social and religious institutions they formed, the buildings they erected, and the boundaries that were imposed on their minds and imaginations were necessities of the rural life of their time. They were products of the land as much as their crops. Their concerns were for survival. They lived in daily contact with the elemental threat of extinction. Even in more recent times, the blessings of science have been offset by the curse of an inscrutable economy, which is as ominous as drought and insects ever were. If I grasp these verities, I begin to better understand not only the place but myself in relationship to it, and my photographic document becomes a lifetime search for my emotional origins.   I have spent most of my life in observation, contemplation, and reaction, and for a long time I did not know what to do with the feelings my nature engendered. They were often overwhelming and occurred faster than I could assimilate them. Our culture affords us a map of detailed possibilities, but living is the sensuous, unpredictable realization of those possibilities just as music is the sensual fulfillment of printed notes.   One day before I knew what to photograph I was driving around the southern part of the county where shade tobacco was grown. It was June and tobacco stalks were bursting through the cheese cloth shades. Black field crews were picking the highest leaves and stacking them on wagons which would take them to the barns. I photographed until I ran out of film. Then I just watched. At the end of the day I had learned a lot about shade tobacco and felt surprisingly close to these carefree seeming people whose lives I knew were anything but carefree. I left feeling exhilarated.   I went back every afternoon, until one day the field was empty. I stood among the stripped stalks where the day before there had been movement and voices. There was silence and stillness except, I recall, for a crow perched on a power line who was upset by my presence. The field, which until now had been the object of such care and concern, was used up. The leaves were all in the barns, and the people were gone to another farm. There was mystery in the wreckage of the field. Instantly I seemed to assimilate everything I had seen during the last week, the work and the social interplay. It added up to feelings too complex and far-flung for words. Only photographs with their capacity to render that which cannot be further reduced would suffice. Later I had a similar experience photographing Battle's Quarters. I was standing in the middle of one of its two narrow, dusty streets looking through the view finder at some children playing when I felt as though I were roughly jerked out of a sound restful sleep into blinding, heartless light. Human beings were surviving without hope, yet every morning they rose and faced another day with vitality and absurd innocence. My feelings were urgent and powerful, brought to consciousness by what I saw, which showed me that I could not expect to &quot;make&quot; photographs. I had to find them. In this groping, testing way, selecting subject matter by the roughness with which it tore me from my complacency I stumbled toward what was to become my subject, Decatur County.   To do justice to a project of this scope one must give unlimited time. The photojournalist intentionally deals w~th the world in a broad, expeditious way: his audience wants only a smattering of what's going on. My documentation of Decatur County addresses a more involved spectator, one who is willing to experience the place emotionally and as an enigma, which necessitates a different time scale.   I rely on instinct to recognize the possibilities for a photograph. Some would find this difficult at home where familiarity blinds. But familiarity is indispensable for   my kind of pictures. How else would you express the desolation a house you have known all your life, passed every day on your way to school, must feel as it is being torn down, eviscerated, its innards scattered across what was once the lawn that proudly adorned it? Familiarity may blind the photographer who is satisfied to skim the surface, but the analyzing eye and the sensitive heart that have memorized every detail of a place from a lifetime of living in it and   feeling it as a reference point, reacts most strongly and   examines closest what it knows best.   I have tried to structure my work in such a way as to suggest the simultaneity and layering of real life. The community does not exist in isolated fragments like photographic images nor in frozen time. An essence of reality is violated when the continuity and flow of life is broken in its transfer to a photograph. Remind yourself that activity in the court house goes on simultaneously with work in factories and on farms. Prayer meetings and church services overlap shopping and the people in church are jurors at the court house. Sunday's picnickers are machine operators on Monday. Every citizen wears many hats, and all the while houses stand looking out on their streets and cemeteries silently wait.   I stand before the Confederate Soldier in the center of the town square, Willis Park, and contemplate Bainbridge on all sides radiating out like brain waves from the soldier as though in a despairing moment he had caused it to materialize. Aesthetically the town is banal and graceless. The ge?erations who built it could barely afford to be expedient, much less stylish. But in many ways it is the perfect artifact and documents the quality and values of their struggle. The challenge is to see beyond the mediocrity to their stamina and determination to squeeze from life something they could use.   The instinct to survive and understand something of   our chaotic world, to love and be loved, to have dignity,   self-respect, and some degree of success, at least in our   own eyes, are common to us all. We have our work, our spiritual, our social, and our economic obligations to honor, and it is often on one of these fronts that we stand toe to toe with our demons. When I aim my camera at religion, people at work, or the court house, I am stalking major themes in which the viewer can discover himself as in a mirror.   Because I chose to live here all my life I make my photographs out of the sentiment of familiarity, the volatility of time, and a strong sense of our mortality. I believe we must acknowledge our nature and finally settle for being human, no matter where or how we live. Everything flows into our humanity, and it is this that the document is really about.   Decatur County is not simple. Life here is all that life is everywhere, and I cannot think of a higher goal than understanding what we can of it.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>PULPWOOD   &quot;It's hard to get up a crew anymore. Nobody wants that kind of job,&quot; Johnny said. lilt's mean and dangerous. It's hot as hell in the summer and you can freeze your ass off in the winter. Sooner or later if a rattle snake don't get you a chain saw or a falling tree will.&quot; Johnny is a pulpwood broker. He buys trees from an owner, then cuts, sells and ships them to a paper mill. We were on our way to a two hundred acre tract of eleven year old pines that the owner wanted thinned so he could hunt quail more comfortably. &quot;Now days we don't do much rotational cutting,&quot; Johnny said. liThe paper companies want clear cutting. It costs less per cord. Most owners prefer to rotate, but they don't hold out for it.&quot;   At eight-thirty the sun was still low in the sky and the atmosphere was clearing itself of a slight haze. It was already humid as we rode down a fire break. Johnny stopped the truck twice to listen for chain saws. When the crew was in sight we left the fire break and took off down the narrow space between rows. We pulled up behind a log truck which, in the tradition of Georgia log trucks, had no headlights, no grill, and doors that were held closed with bailing wire.   I climbed with my camera out of Johnny's truck and found myself standing not in pastoral quiet and harmony but in a factory whose function was the mass production of timber. The chain saws were loudly discharging small clouds of noxious blue exhaust. The log truck was a mechanical mutation, an iron skeleton that roared loudly as it crawled among the trees. The whole forest was an assembly line.   Chain saws can be treacherous. They can kick back and take off a hand or a foot or rip open a skull. Flying bark can put out an eye. Uncommon strength and endurance are needed to operate a chain saw eight to ten hours a day through a south Georgia summer. Not the kind you get in a gym or from swimming or tennis, but the kind you develop in order to survive by doing dirty work that no one else wants. The muscles aren't symetrical or aesthetic but they're massive and strong. The bending, lifting and chucking of the men who load the cut wood   on the truck takes stamina too. When the tree is first cut thick, sticky   sap runs like blood from the wound. In summer the men are drenched   in a combination of perspiration and sap. Pine needles, bark, and saw   dust coat their chests and backs. Add to this the annoyance of huge   biting flies, gnats, red bugs, chiggers and rattle snakes that move silently   in the dense underbrush, and you understand that loggers are a special&quot;&quot;t!IJ breed.   I doubt they think of themselves as such--it is probably my   own idiosyncrasy--but like many who perform dangerous and unsav  ory manual labor under adverse conditions there is something heroic   in their willingness and strength, and it was this I was most conscious   of as I made the photographs.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>DECATUR COUNTY NEWSPAPERS   Nothing imparts the rituals and small dramas of everyday life with   their flavor in tact like a rural county newspaper. Pretensions and styles   show through with authenticity and grace that would be lost in a transla  tion, and more importantly, hard information about attitudes toward life   and death are em bedded in the vernacular. The extravagant sentimentality   and the ingenuousness with which a subject like death is dealt with informs   us that death was once held in high esteem, a fact we should know.   DEATH OF YOUNG BURKE AT 5 O'CLOCK DECEMBER 26,1916   The young man and his father were fishing in a pond near their home when his father fell out of the boat and in trying to get back into the boat, he turned it over, Jim swam almost to shore and seemingly cramped, called to his father to save him, he sank and never rose.   Mr. Burke managed to get on the bow of the boat and by calling, neighbors heard him and came to the rescue and saved his life. Five hours later the body of young Jim was found.   He was the son of Mr. Ii Mrs. Sim Burke, of Lake Hinton. He was 17 years old and his death was quite a shock to the community. That roseate bloom that adorned his young face, that dear face that made him such a precious one in his home and school, will never be forgotten. He was so delighted in his studies at school and was always prompt with his lessons. Jim was a boy who dearly loved his mother and it seems so hard to give him up, but &quot;the Lord knoweth best and doeth all things well.&quot;   We know that it breaks the father's heart to know that he couldn't   go when his child called for help.   Jim was loved by all who knew him, he had such pleasant ways. He will be missed by that dear mother. He leaves his father and mother and three brothers to mourn his death but we can console their broken hearts by saying, weep not, but strive to meet him in a brighter land.   His body was interred in the Salem Cemetery Wednesday afternoon in the presence of a large and sorrowing crowd. The mother said these lines:   A precious one from us is gone,   A voice we loved is stilled.   A place is vacant in our home,   vvhich never can be filled.     Post-Searchlight, January 4,1917. Front page.     The raw material for operas, novels, and plays, contrived as it is   by the time it reaches its audience, was once life. Decatur County, no   less than London or New York, is the site of violent, absorbing adventures.   NEGRO GIRL MURDERED BODY THROWN IN RIVER   Bessie Hadly, a negro girl that lived near Amsterdam, was dragged from the river a few days ago and one Jake Peterson was jail charged with her murder. The girl had been missing a few days and the police were notified as also the sheriff's office and a search was made for her. Her slipper was found on the bank of the river and the officers had the river dragged near there and found her body.   The police who had been working on the case in conjunction with the sheriff had evidence that Jake had something to do with her disappearance and when the body was found Chief Barber and Sheriff Martin went out and landed Jake in short order. Both departments doing good work in the quick apprehension of the criminal. It seems that Jake had been living with the girl illegally and when he found out that she was going to marry he killed her, fooling her off down on the river and broke her neck and threw her into the water. It is a bad case both white and colored people are worked up over it. A more foul murder could not be committed. The negro is in jail and will be punished for his offense.   Post-Searchlight, March 16, 1916.   Modest, personal celebrations, punctuating and breaking the monotony   of the years, become news worthy in a small community.   LITTLE JANE JACKSON CELEBRATES BIRTHDAY   Monday afternoon Mrs. Willie Mae Jackson was hostess to a large number of little folks in honor of the fifth birthday of her little daughter, Jane. All dressed up in white organdy and lace Jane met her guests in the hall and received their gifts in a very cunning manner. Untying them as she explained, &quot;some that had already come.'1 After enjoying the gifts and games the children were invited into the dining room where a lovely table was set with a beautiful birthday cake making the center piece. The cake was white and was surrounded by spengeria ferns and narcissi with five small red candles grouped in the center. Jane cut the first slice but her mother assisted the guests in their cutting. Annie Johnson cut the ring, Frances Rich the dime, Loraine Rushing the thimble, and Mamie Hinley Brinson the button. Then ice cream and cookies were served. Just before the girls and boys said goodbye Mrs. Jackson pinned adorable little favors on. The favors were made of bright colored candies which were wrapped in white tissue paper with the long twisted ends drawn through lace paper mats which frilled up over the candies and bright red ribbons tied the finishing touch. The guests were Ruth Custer, Mary Theresa Shackleford, David Shackleford, Carey Cox, Jane Harrell, Margaret Conger, Fields Varner, Marjorie Perkins, Buster Payton, Freddie Ward, Edna Gray, Robert Ausley, Byron Bower, William Tonge, Billy King, Gerard Kwilecki, Annie Johnson, Jack Tonge, Wheat, Smith, Chapelle, Willow Mathis, Loraine Rushing, Thomas Range Rushing.   Mrs. Nancy Maddox, Eloise Cox, and Sadie DesVerges assisted in entertaining.   Post-Searchlight, January 12, 1922.   Four days after Pearl Harbor the following appeared on the front   page of the Post-Searchlight:   MRS. C. S. HADDON'S POEM HEARD OVER RADIO WEDNESDAY   Mrs. C. S. Haddon's many friends will be interested in learning that one of her poems, liThe Tree and Me,lI was heard over radio station WROK,   Rockford, Illinois, last Wednesday, December 10, at 11:15 o'clock. Her poem was featured on the II Musical PortraitsII Hour and was read by Miss   Lorna Lane.   Post-Searchlight, December II, 1941. Front page.   PRESENTED TO SOCIETY IN ATLANTA, DECEMBER 18   Miss Billie Bob Howell, charming young daughter of Mrs. Robert Young   Howell of this city, made her formal debut at the Piedmont Driving Club,   Atlanta, jointly with Miss Joan Jagels, secretary of the Debutant Club   and Miss Jean Fraser, both of Atlanta ...   Billie Bob chose a very lovely gown for the occasion. Being blonde and   hazel-eyed, she decided on blue ---very pale blue organza over satin.   Soft shirring trims the drop shoulders and the very full skirt is topped   by a wide peplum that stands out crisply around the hips. Her gloves were   of white net ...   Post-Searchlight, December 19, 1946.   The moral, religious and well disposed citizens of Bainbridge, presuming the church going people hereabouts had emerged from their uncouth habits and unchristian and indecent ways of heathenism to authorize such an improvement to the town, contributed liberally and erected last year a splendid and for this ne-w section of the county, a magnificent Methodist Church. But how sadly have they been disappointed. The tobacco chewers have not only besmeared and bespattered with their filthy saliva, the floor, seats and church walls on their own side of the house, but have leaned over and disgorged themselves of the aromatic contents of their mouths on the seats and floor of the side occupied by the ladies!   We hope the Trustees will take the matter in hand, and appropriate certain seats in the house especially to those who chew tobacco in church so that people not fond of the weed will know where to seat themselves. We suggest that said seats be painted black and several car loads of sand and sawdust be emptied between them, so that this division of worshippers ... may be permitted to enjoy themselves at church in their own way.   Bainbridge Argus, April IS, 1856.   A STRAWBERRY FESTIVAL   The ladies of the Presbyterian Sunday School will hold a strawberry festival at the Court House tomorrow night to raise funds for Sunday School purposes. No exorbitant prices will be charged, but everything will be cheap. The Silver Cornet Band will furnish music. All Presbyterians especially will be expected to lend their aid, and not leave everything for outsiders to do, as they did on a former like occasion.   Bainbridge Argus, 1882.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>Restoring the Decatur County Courthouse 1998 -2000   The committee in charge of remodeling the Decatur County Courthouse wanted to restore it to its original condition insofar as that was possible given today's fire codes, anti-segregation laws, and the committee's impressions of what the courthouse looked like in 1904. The undertaking was so extensive all offices and the court were removed to temporary facilities scattered around Bainbridge.   At the insistence of the U.S Supreme Court, the balcony in the courtroom originally segregated for African-Americans had been hidden behind a drop ceiling in 1970. It was again exposed, this time with seating for all. There were no more separate white and &quot;colored&quot; restrooms. Layers of paint were removed from curly pine wainscoting, and the hardwood floors were sanded and coated with high gloss polyurethane finishes that didn't exist when the courthouse was built. I suspect the courtroom in its callow youth never looked like this. The artless linseed oil soaked planks, window blinds, and wainscoting of 1904 would have been no match for the same wood burnished and finished now with the latest polymer varnishes and stains, an example of the seductive power of technology. If it can be done, do it. Never mind that it flies in the face of authentic restoration, the purpose of which is to give us a reminder of where we came from. Worse, how does one explain a digital sound system and a TV monitor for every two jurors in a century old courtroom?   To strip away layers of old paint and perform unskilled tasks, inmates from the Decatur County Correctional Institute were used, most of whom were African-Americans. It struck me as ironic that descendants of individuals who were denied justice under law, should be used to restore a courthouse that was an altar to white supremacy. Not only was justice subverted but the chains of segregation became as binding as those of slavery. They were forged in this edifice. Intimidation was the fire; humiliation was the anvil.   From the start the convicts reminded me of shade tobacco workers I photographed forty years ago, prisoners of a different kind. Like shade tobacco people, the prisoners were strikingly individual and profoundly human. Most, from the Decatur County area, were serving short sentences for relatively minor violations. They took pleasure in each other's company and seemingly even in mine. Also like the tobacco workers the prisoner's wit was quick, virile, and decidedly sexual.   Dangling high above the sidewalks on a rickety platform out of earshot of the guards, one husky prisoner regaled his mates for two days with details of his girlfriend's sexual prowess. He was so good that the foreman had twice as many volunteers as he needed for the risky assignment.   A few prisoners were introverts. One kept staring out of a window at people passing on the street. He talked about the problems he would face when he got out. He was intelligent and articulate, ambitious, and worried about his future as a black male with a record.   The grandfather of one very young prisoner came every day and waited on the sweltering sidewalk until his grandson had a break and could stand at a window and wave.   The day before Thanksgiving the county had a traditional turkey dinner for the prisoners on the court house grounds. It was catered food, not their regular fare, and they could eat as much as they wanted.   At the dedication service when all signs of the muscle, sweat, and monotony that had gone into the restoration had been hidden and nothing remained but warm woods and glossy surfaces, I was introduced to a state Supreme Court justice who eyed my cameras and said, &quot;Those are fine looking cameras.&quot;   &quot;Looks can be misleading,&quot; I said. &quot;Actually, they're just two black boxes with lenses on them. The only thing that matters is the picture.&quot; Gesturing toward the newly digitized courtroom, I said, &quot;Isn't it the same here? After two years and six million bucks still the only thing that counts is the verdict.&quot;    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>La Grange Talk: 2/17/99   My father is buried less than a mile from the spot where he was born, married, worked for sixty years, and died. I was born in the same place, have lived there all my life, and will be buried beside my wife, mother and father, brother, uncles and aunts, my grandfather, grandmother, great-grandfather and great-grandmother.   Decatur County is the world to me. Little of importance exists beyond it that doesn't also exist there. My love for it is as old as I am and however deep I am. For nearly forty years I have sought to understand and photograph it in a way that will clarify the meaning of a place some say has no meaning.   The task is complicated because I am only one man, one mind, one pair of eyes trying to identify what is significant in an entire community. I have positive responses and negative responses shaped by my personality which, in turn, is shaped by my heredity and experience, and these must be registered faithfully, for they are the litmus paper, the reactions that humanize the document, give it a point-of-view, and make it more than a catalogue. In fiction the omnipotent author smooths out incongruities so that they flow like tributaries into the main theme, giving the work seamless continuity. But I am making a factual record, articulated by chemical processes that are remarkable, yet sometimes have a stubborn disinclination to conform to our esthetic wishes. Much is lost in translation from reality to photographs ofreality, most of it in simplifying life's dense textures. For that reason it is encumbent on the photographer, reacting rationally and emotionally, to project his own personality as a norm against which to play the contradictions and paradoxes that abound in the real world. They can't be resolved -life itself doesn't resolve them, but they are wonderous to behold and add piquant authenticity. This dilemma is likely to be felt on a subliminal level first, then raised to thinking consciously about what it all means.   To observe and organize one's information so that others can understand its richness is a challenge worthy of a long, well-tuned lifetime. In the kind of documentary photography that I practice one must reconstitute some ground rules. Because my mind, not my camera, is my essential instrument, merely beautiful photographs aren't enough. Truth takes top priority. This is not lowering esthetic standards, merely rearranging them. The splendor of an image better reside in its subject matter than in facile surfaces. Photographs are no longer discrete objects. They join related photographs to embrace their subject, not merely in appearance but in complexity and nuance. The re-creation, feelingwise, of local institutions and the life that buzzes around them is what matters.   In today's climate of photographer-as-artist this seems a dubious idea. In many museums, photography galleries, and college photography departments, the concept that photographs are collectibles and, by implication, valuable objects in themselves, is thought to enhance the stature, not to mention the marketability, of photography, the photographer, and the museum, gallery, or college. In other words, an attitude has been artificially inseminated and cultured that has its roots in self-promotion and marketing rather than in the realities of the medium.   Magazines like Life and Look once supplied a market so voracious for picture stories that they were able to boil off photographic documentation and get as a distillate photojournalism. They packaged it as a streamlined way of relaying news; the implication being that it was faster and more felicitous for the harried housewife or businessman. As a matter of fact, documentary photography was never intended to be the town crier. It was meant to inform in a reflective, encyclopedic way. Since the demise of Life and its siblings, television has taken their place and the market for photo-journalism, much less full blown visual documentation, in print has all but dried up. Now and then a gallery or a magazine will publish individual or a small group of documentary images as art, but space can seldom be found for documentary photography in its full glory.   Not only are the venues for documentary photographs shrinking, interest in the kind of subject matter that lends itself to documentary treatment is under siege from an axis that runs from media to industry. Athletes, actors, and rock stars whose names and careers can be tied to products are heroes, and year after year the hype gets louder and more deafening. In such an environment, photographs of ordinary lives seem colorless and uninteresting. Truth seems beside the point, or at best old-fashioned. Is it merely coincidence tlwt the twentieth century has produced the most extraordinary technology in the lzistoryofcivilization bittnota Shakespeare noraMozart noraMicJzelangelo, nor any artist remotely approaching them?   Feeling is one of the highest forms of knowing. Most of our finest insights are launched by instinct, which is nothing more than reason getting ahead of itself. The seed of my Decatur County project was sewn in 1960 when I saw black workers covering fields in yellow and white cheesecloth shades twelve feet high for a kind of tobacco that is used for the wrapper of cigars. It was a labor-intensive crop grown in only two places in the United States: the southwest Georgianorthwest Florida region and central Connecticut. The workers caught my eye immediately. They were the last survivors of a subculture that had run its course. They were vivid and exuberant. Most striking was their robust sense of humor which, along with their stamina, enabled them to endure hours of back-breaking work in the intense heat of south Georgia summers.   The farms on which shade tobacco was grown were the last vestiges of ante-bellum plantations. Because growing this kind of crop required a certain acuity and experience, most workers lived on or near the farm, and when tobacco was out of season temporary jobs were found to tide them over until the next crop. Shade tobacco was planted and fertilized by hand, the furrows were plowed by mules, and the leaves picked by hand. It was on its way out when I arrived on the scene, but in spite of the urgency I spent four years getting to know the workers and encouraging them to trust me. I had an inchoate sense that I had found my life's work, the study of one culture over many years. Decatur County was a place I knew better than any other, whose very normality made it anonymous on the one hand but was pregnant with the kind of truth from which all life is made on the other. That no glamour or acclaim would accrue from such an undertaking, reminded me of something Berenice Abbott said: /I Acclaim is, after all, not the essential reward. The act of creating has its own reward, and it is primary. When one embarks on an uncertain venture, silence is often an ally. Anonymity becomes an asset, if not a necessity.&quot;   To skip several years and a couple of series that came in between, I was drawn to the Decatur County Courthouse as a subject because it is where politics gets down to the individual. No matter how much newsprint is expended on politicians and their shenanigans, or how much air time is devoted to Washington and the beltway, it isn't until the laws that are enacted make contact with you and me personally that we feel the yoke of government. The courthouse, where Decatur Countians come to pay taxes, serve on juries, buy license plates, answer summons, seemed a likely place to look at what civil responsibility is all about. The courthouse pictures are not a metaphor; flley are tile reality-my fellow Decatur Countians entangled, for whatever reasons, with the law as the embodiment, arbiter, and policeman of society. The series is assuredly no abstraction or hypothesis. In the Decatur County Courthouse the hard institutional surfaces of the building collide with the vulnerability of the people to produce an atmosphere of estrangement and anxiety. In its most authoritative mode, the courthouse is where one may enter a free man and exit a prisoner. The collective will of society, euphemistically called justice, can fall like a sledge hammer.   As the Courthouse Series is about civil life, the Churches of Decatur County is a series about spiritual life. The emphasis is on people not structures. To me church buildings are of interest only when they bespeak the intensity of the people who built them; when they reflect   their virility and passion, and when they show how poverty can turn less into more.   Worshipers and the ministers themselves are the story. To put yourself in their midst and observe how they contrive to communicate with God is a feast for the eyes, a smorgasbord of faith, imagination, and intelligence that is rare, and even more rarely visible. It is a fascinating, inexhaustible source of information about the human brain and its incapacity to keep sacred ideas from secular corruption.   Amazing gifts of fancy and illusion are in evidence. The inspiration ranges from pedestrian to genius and is impossible to sustain without the back and forth flow of energy between congregation and minister. The sanctuary can be awash with vitality. It flows from preacher to congregation and from congregation to preacher like a Ping-Pong ball between two champions. It is a stunning volley and is utterly camera-ready.   But if you're a spectator in what is essentially not a spectator sport, the real cachet is the sincerity and trust of the tacit contract between minister and congregation. It is so innocent, yet it is also essential that both parties agree on the syntax of this ritual, that the shouting is not really shouting but is supplication to God and the dancing is the human body under seige by the holy spirit. Otherwise one might be tempted, in this skeptical age, to call it a performance, contrived and melodramatic; which would be egregious indifference to both the power of the IWlIlall spirit as well as the divine one. These are highly developed forms, the product of exotic imaginations; the same kind of unfettered imagination that in another discipline carried man from Kitty Hawk to the moon in a few short years.   Another extensive series is devoted to the Workers of Decatur County. We inherited from our Puritan antecedents the idea that work is ennobling, a concept that went unchallenged until recently when technology shot it out of the saddle. Whether a necessity or to prove a point, a job is the center of gravity for most Decatur Countians who live at least a third of their lives in the workplace. I wanted to know if we are the same people in the dust and heat of the fields or the noise and chaos of the factory as we are in our beds at night. Initially photographing men and women on the job was my way of finding out if the essence of one's personality is somehow immune to hostile, sometimes dehumanizing environments. One would expect that good workers take only their skills to work, leaving the rest of themselves at home. Yet the reality is otherwise. Field and factory workers show no signs of compartmentalizing. Watching them on the job and talking to them one gets a sense of the whole person: lively, curious, ready to talk about themselves, families, their problems, and each other. Never less than whole people whose animated faces and personalities imply rich lives outside the farm or factory, they are breadwinners for eight hours. For the other sixteen they may be parents, lovers, shoppers, worshipers, or defendants, and they never entirely leave these other parts of themselves behind.   The Willis Park series reflects the public side of the socio-political history of Decatur County. Willis Park is the square block in the middle of downtown Bainbridge at the center of which is a statue of tILe Confederate soldier. Originally intended as a stern spiritual extension of the courthouse, he looks east across Broad Street where parades and funeral processions pass. He has witnessed shoot-outs, political rallies, lynchings, patriotic celebrations, the antics of itinerant preachers, and, most recently, the Junior-Senior Proms. He has seen businesses come and go, the truck replace the mule and wagon, and literally thousands of citizens on their way to eternity. I am happy to report that during the last three decades he has been steadily demoted from authority figure to ornamental relic. Today he looks benignly down on weddings in the gazebo, speechmaking candidates for public office, and a wide variety of community occasions without regard for race or gender.   There are other series: Stores and Shoppers in which customers look like stalkers; Cemeteries-what we do with our grief and our memories; the Flint River, a series that attempts to show how the river shapes life along its banks; a now vanished ghetto called Battles' Quarters; the Trailways Bus Station; Carnivals; Swine Time-an annual nod to the importance of livestock in the economy; and Icons, what statuary and graffiti in public places tell us about ourselves; to name just a few of the briefer series.   All began with a hunch and grew as I let myself be led by instinct, sentiment, and the camera. The whole undertaking was-and still is-an exploration. Once I looked through the viewfinder, the place where I was born and raised didn't look the same. Putting a frame around it, forced choices: what to include and what to exclude, which neutralized a great deal of the familiarity. Life in Decatur County became life, pure and simple, simultaneously specific and universal: people worked and played, had families, lived under political and social orders, attended to their spiritual needs, and died. The images, as they came out of the camera, clarified and verified. But collectively and at their best they were more than a laundry list of activities. Some were beautiful or funny or sad or poetic in their ordinariness, especially those that deracinated reality and froze it in time. They provide an opportunity to look at ourselves as we really are-a much needed antidote for the noisy, aggressive world of the rich and famous.   This show is a sampler, an abridged version of the project. It could be likened to the summary of a novel: the bare bones plot is here, but the characters and relationships aren't developed. For example, from the twelve pictures of the Courthouse Series that are on display you can get the idea, but the continuity and momentum are lost. The series ends with photographs of prisoners at the County Farm -incarceration-of which in the unedited document there are twelve prints. Here there are but four.   Alas, we live in the age of sound bites.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>In March 1983, I was invited to a hog killing at the county farm, a euphemism for Decatur County Correctional Institution. I got there at 6:30 AM. The wind was cold and bitter. First light was in the sky but not enough to make out faces. I parked my car and the warden came to meet me. &quot;I thought you'd like this,&quot; he said. Behind him about fifteen prisoners were butchering hogs. &quot;Let me show you what we do, then you can take whatever pictures you want.&quot; He walked me around explaining, &quot;We grow everything the prisoners eat right here on the farm. The hogs are shot over yonder.&quot; He pointed toward a big pen. &quot;Carcasses are brought over and dumped in this vat.&quot; He indicated a rusty iron boiler that had been sawed in half longitudinally and mounted on concrete blocks over an open fire that the prisoners were stoking with small logs. It was full of steaming water. &quot;Then the guy with the hoe scrapes the hair off the hide. After that the carcass is hung over there to be dressed.&quot; Two men were vigorously stabbing and slicing the underbelly of a hog, trying to cut through the stubborn layers of adipose tissue. They seemed unaware that they were standing in a spreading pool of blood and yellow fat. We walked over to a convict at a table with three heads on it. &quot;He's taking the brains and tongues out. We use everything here.&quot; The warden was proud of his operation. He raised his voice: &quot;Men, this man's a photographer. He's going to be taking some pictures. Any of you don't want to be in them, don't have to, but say so now.&quot; No one said anything. So I waited for more light and watched the men struggle with the weight of the hogs. They seemed no different from many Decatur County farmers who were at this moment performing the same ritual in their own back yards.   Daylight came; slowly at first, then faster as things took on familiar shapes and textures. All of it was depressing: the gray soft light, the wind, the prisoners with their awkward attempts at hiding their shame, the corny landscape-steam rising out of a vat and bare, thorny bushes circling the clearing like barbed wire. Then I looked at the men individually. Suddenly I understood that it was not the scenery or the hog carcasses that were oppressive. It was the men; their bloom, the beads of sweat standing up on their foreheads in the cold wind, their young bodies in loose cotton uniforms and heavy mud caked boots, their eyes bright and clear and full of pain. And the guards, talking amiably but carrying shotguns and pistols, watching everything out of the corner of their eyes. A shiver went through me more chilling than the wind.   It was the worst slum in town. Houses were fifteen feet apart. A fire in one house would have burned all the others. Battles' Quarters was built by Battles &amp; Metcalf Lumber Co. for employees during World War II. The lumber company closed in 1948, and the houses were rented to anyone who was too broke to live anywhere else. They were like the house Balzac described in Pere Cariat: &quot;poverty without poetry.&quot;   When it rained, water poured from the street into yards. It formed lakes covering the refuse that littered the ground and flooding privies. The whole place smelled of rot and urine.   Structures were uniform: twelve feet wide by thirty feet long with two partitions forming three rooms. There was no hallway. To go from front to back, it was necessary to walk through all three rooms. Because of cracks in the floor and broken window panes the houses could not be heated in winter. In summer they were hot enough to drive tennants to the porchs and yards.   Life was lived alfresco. There were no trees. The only shade was shadows cast by the houses themselves, which moved as the sun moved.   Whether Battles' Quarters attracted people already dehumanized or whether it transformed them after they got there was a moot point. They received welfare checks for not working and/or for bearing bastard children. Money was doled to them without supervision or rules. Because the system was bureaucratic and, as such systems are, impersonal, the only reality was the check every month. Insidiously the idea of employment and family lost meaning.   Both men and women adapted to living in the quarters by giving up their privacy and the schedules most people live by. As if afraid of being alone, they formed groups: in yards, on porches, or on junk cars that were battered and on blocks. Individuals left the group to eat, sleep, or move to another group. They might return later or they might go to bed for the remainder of the day, lie on the splintered floor of the porch, or withdraw to the front room and noisily fight or have sex with doors and windows open. Someone else would take their place. Faces changed, but the group remained.   Apprehensive at first about photographing, I pretended to be taking pictures in the street. When I saw that my presence got no reaction whatsoever, my curiosity was aroused. I moved closer. I approached two men and a woman who were having a conversation   and asked if I could take a picture. They agreed without asking why and returned to their talk.   Life in the quarters was beyond apathetic. Nothing mattered. Morning was not fresh, and evening was not the end of the day. A family of fourteen resided in a single house. There was a bed and three mattresses on the floor. All were occupied around the clock. The quarters' stud, a muscular man without shirt or shoes was much in demand. He asked for sixteen dollars to buy a bus ticket to Atlanta. He was cocky and asked again every time he saw me. When he didn't have a partner, he spent his nights in a 1948 Buick from which the front seats had been removed.   I arrived one morning to find a very fat woman leaning on her porch railing. She looked like an inflated doll that was about to burst. What a photograph she would make! But I didn't stop the car. I was sure that if I approached, she would say something and change her position, and the picture depended on her staying exactly as she was. I looked back. She was still there. I stopped, got a camera out of the rear seat and went back to the house, took six or eight shots, returned to the car, and as I drove away looked again. She had not said a word nor moved a muscle since I first saw her.   Finally Battle's Quarters became unbearable -not to its residents -to the people who lived around it. They objected to having it in their neighborhood and having their noses rubbed in its filth. For years they protested to the city and finally got it condemned and demolished. Now there is one dirt street ending under an expressway exit. It's as if the place imploded of its own putrefaction and like the black hole that it was took everything with it. The weeds and wild flowers that grow out of the sandy ground give no indication of it or its society.   The committee in charge of remodeling the Decatur County Courthouse wanted to restore it to its original condition insofar as that was possible given today's fire codes, anti-segregation laws, and the committee's impressions of what the courthouse looked like in 1904. The undertaking was so extensive all offices and the court were removed to temporary facilities scattered around Bainbridge.   At the suggestion of the U.s Supreme Court, the balcony in the courtroom originally segregated for African-Americans had been hidden behind a drop ceiling in 1970. It was again exposed, this time with seating for all. There were no more separate white and&quot;colored&quot; restrooms. Layers of paint were removed from curly pine wainscoting, and the hardwood floors were sanded and coated with high gloss polyurethane finishes that didn't exist when the courthouse was built. I suspect the courtroom in its callow youth never looked like this. The artless linseed oil soaked planks, window blinds, and wainscoting of 1904 would have been no match for the same wood burnished and finished now with the latest polymer varnishes and stains, an example of the seductive power of technology. If it can be done, do it. Never mind that it flies in the face of authentic restoration, the purpose of which is to give us a reminder of where we came from. Worse, how does one explain a digital sound system and a TV monitor for every two jurors in a century old courtroom?   To strip away layers of old paint and perform unskilled tasks, inmates from the Decatur County Correctional Institute were used, most of whom were African-Americans. It struck me as ironic that descendants of individuals who were denied justice under law, should be used to restore a courthouse that was an altar to white supremacy. Not only was justice subverted but the chains of dehumanizing segregation became as binding as those of slavery. They were forged in this edifice. Intimidation was the fire; humiliation was the anvil.   From the start the convicts reminded me of shade tobacco workers I photographed forty years ago -prisoners of a different kind. Most, from the Decatur County area, were serving short sentences for relatively minor violations. They took pleasure in each other's company and seemingly even in mine. Also like the tobacco workers the prisoner's wit was quick, virile, and decidedly sexual.   Dangling high above the sidewalks on a rickety platform out of earshot of the guards, one husky prisoner regaled his mates for two days with details of his girlfriend's sexual prowess. He was so good that the foreman had twice as many volunteers as he needed for the risky assignment.   A few were introverts. One kept staring out of a window at people passing on the street. He talked about the problems he would face when he got out. He was intelligent and articulate, ambitious, and worried about his future as a black male with a record.   The father of one very young prisoner came every day and waited on the sweltering sidewalk until his son had a break and could stand at a window and wave.   The day before Thanksgiving the county had a traditional turkey dinner for the prisoners on the court house grounds. It was catered food, not their regular fare, and they could eat as much as they wanted.   At the dedication service when all signs of the muscle, sweat, and monotony that had gone into the restoration had been hidden and nothing remained but warm woods and glossy surfaces, I was introduced to a state Supreme Court justice who eyed my cameras and said, &quot;Those are fine lDoking cameras.&quot;   &quot;Looks can be misleading,&quot; I said. I was trying to be polite, but I was annoyed. &quot;Actually, they're just two black boxes with lenses on them. The only thing that matters is the picture.&quot; Gesturing toward the newly digitized courtroom, I said, &quot;Isn't it the same here? After two years and six million bucks still the only thing that counts is the verdict.&quot;   THE JUNIOR-SENIOR PROM   When I graduated from Bainbridge High School fifty-five years ago, a banq~et was given in honor of the senior class. By today's standards, it was drab. AlII remember were the frayed tablecloths, the crazed dinner plates, and half a chicken that had to be eaten with a knife and fork.   Bainbridge was -and in many ways still is -a quintessential Georgia town: depressed and moribund. Its heroes were Franklin Roosevelt, Robert E. Lee, and Jesus Christ in that order. A &quot;banquet&quot; in the Stephen Decatur's private dining room where the Rotary Club met on Tuesdays was, as far as Bainbridge High School was concerned, about as much honor as it was prudent to bestow on sixteen and seventeen year olds.   Today, with understatement, the event is called simply the JuniorSenior Prom. For over ten years I've photographed the overture to this prom, the taking of formal photographs in Willis Park followed by a promenade, which has become so extravagant that the dance afterwards seems almost like an afterthought. It begins at five thirty with the arrival of white stretch limos and a vintage Rolls-Royce bearing two to six couples per car. Some Seniors arrive less ostentatiously, but regardless of how they get there, they are young, beautiful, and at the epicenter of their innocence and vitality.   The girls, wearing evening gowns, makeup, and coiffures that have cost them the whole day and a great deal of money, show nervous excitement one minute, poise the next. They carry roses, orchids, or lilies across their tender, white forearms. The boys wear tuxedos or full-dress suits. Their hair has been moussed and combed, they are clean shaven, and obviously self-conscious, lest they should spoil the effect. Irrelevant as the cosmetics, hairdos, and finery are to the real splendor of these young gods and goddesses, the attention that has been lavished on their exteriors cries out for approval and admiration. It prompts me to ask myself if I were ever this animated and vain.   A few of mothers have gone from excitement to agitation. They stand, cameras in hand, at the curb awaiting the arrival of their daughters, whom, when they come, they arrange in a row for snapshots, not realizing that they have set them on the green marble memorial to Decatur County's war dead. No one notices. I move to catch it: In the slanting sunshine, these adolescents, full of life and excitement, juxtaposed against the names of men who died so that they might have this moment, are oblivious to the exquisite irony. I ask myself what those men would think if they could see this scene. Would they be offended by the desecration, or would they feel fulfilled that that it was their sacrifice that made this day? I am thrilled at having caught if only for a second a glimpse of the underbelly of life before it disappears again below the surface of the afternoon.   The photographer has hung a sheet with plastic flowers across the entrance to the gazebo. A couple takes their place in front of it while an assistant straightens a boy's tie and smoothes a girl's hair. The assistant steps back, the photographer signals, the couple smiles, and the flash goes off. Another couple replaces them.   By six o'clock the line is long and the park so full of parents and grandparents that it is impossible to move. When all of the Seniors have had their pictures made, they form a line for the promenade. As each couple's name and the names of their parents is called, they step forward and circle the Confederate Soldier. When the last couple has promenaded, they go by whatever means they arrived, to dinner, the dance, and breakfast. I am told that the cost for such an evening can exceed six hundred dollars for a young man and his date, almost half a year's after-school wages. The crowd in Willis Park disperses, and it is once more a deserted town square.   What will become of these boys and girls in whom I see myself and for whom I feel familiar anxieties? What will come between them and their muse? Which appetites will lift them, which will soil them? Tonight, wrapped in affection and pride, reality is out. Fantasy is in.   Except for a solid and unmoved sentry: the Confederate Soldier. He has witnessed on this very ground the suspension of other realities. He stands at parade rest, his marble face limned by the moonlight, his eyes fixed on the east where tomorrow will rise like the curtain on act two.   Dr. Morty Ehrlich was born in Bainbridge in 1893. He and his brother, Sigo, practiced medicine together until Sigo's death in 1936.   On Dr. Ehrlich's eighty-fifth birthday, I was called to take his picture. His office, which predated the first hospital in Bainbridge, had, in addition to a treabnent room, an operating room. Although it had been forty years since the last surgery was performed there, it was fully equipped and ready for the next patient.   While I set up the camera facing the operating table, Morty reminisced aloud about what had gone on in this room, finally coming to rest on a case he relished. Here is his story: a girl in her twenties who fell from a horse was brought in unconscious. She had extensive head injuries, the most urgent of which was a subdural hematoma. Unless pressure inside her skull were relieved she would die. There was no neurosurgeon south of Macon, and there was not time to move her. Sigo, the spokesman for the pair, explained this to her family and got their consent to do what they could.   The two physicians took a volume on surgery of the head to the operating room. Sigo operated and Morty read: then Morty operated and Sigo read. Eventually both pairs of hands were needed. They drilled holes in the skull and removed a section. They worked past blood vessels to the dura matter. The clot could not be removed. They stanched the bleeding, but the brain had blood on it and was beginning to swell. They suctioned, then decided that with no more training and equipment than they had it would be prudent to stop. They closed and put the patient in a small space off the operating room where Morty and Sigo took turns pulling her through one crisis after another. To their surprise she lived to be transferred. The neurosurgeon in Macon praised their handling of the case.   Morty was proud of himself. In a lifetime of possibilities, this was his moment. A few years later Sigo died of cancer, and the practice shrank to insurance examinations, company physicals, and obstetrics. I knew from the taut way Morty told the story, stripping it to its essentials, using enough medical jargon to give it authority and make it convincing, that he had toid it often and with concern for its effect. Drama is like seasoning: a little goes in when the dish is cooked. The rest is added when it is served.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>The Junior-Senior Prom   When I graduated from Bainbridge High School fifty-seven years ago, a banquet was given in honor of the senior class. By today's standards, it was drab. All I remember were the frayed tablecloths, the crazed dinner plates, and half a chicken that had to be eaten with a knife and fork.   Bainbridge was -and in many ways still is -a quintessential Georgia town: depressed and moribund. Its heroes were Franklin Roosevelt, Robert E. Lee, and Jesus Christ in that order. A &quot;banquet&quot; in the Stephen Decatur's private dining room where the Rotary Club met on Tuesdays was, as far as Bainbridge High School was concerned, about as mlich honor a was prudent to bestow on sixteen and seventcell year alds.   Today, with understatement, the event is called simply the Junior-Senior Prom. For eleven years I've photographed the overture to the prom, the taking of formal photographs in Willis Park followed by a promenade, which has become so extravagant that the dance afterwards seems like an afterthought. It begins at five thirty with the arrival of white limousines and a vintage Rolls-Royce bearing two to six couples per car. Some seniors arrive less ostentatiously, but regardless of how they get there, they are young, beautiful, and at the epicenter of their innocence and vitality.   The girls, wearing evening gowns, makeup, and coiffures that have cost them the better part of the day and a great deal of money, show excitement one minute, poise the next. They carry roses, orchids, or lilies across their tender, white forearms. The boys wear tuxedos or full-dress suits. Their hair has been styled, not just trimmed. They are clean shaven and obviously self-conscious lest they spoil the effect. But there is more here than well scrubbed enthusiasm. Smiles are too broad, laughter too jittery, speech too animated.   I did not set out to show that the Junior-Senior Prom i~ a rite of passage. The evidence mounted year after year in the photographs. It is a rehearsal for major rituals, marriage for example, and an introduction to the arbitrariness of social life. For many, it is the first time they have competed for a rung on the social ladder. The responsibility weighs heavily and can be seen by the camera in unguarded moments. Irrelevant as all this is to the real splendor of these young gods and goddesses, the pressure that builds from family and spectators is immense. Expectations must be met. Rules must be observed. Below the surface innocence is giving way to tribal traditions.   A few mothers have gone from excitement to agitation. They stand, cameras in hand, at the curb awaiting the arrival of their daughters. As soon as they are out of the limousine, the daughters and their dates are arranged in a row for snapshots along the gray marble memorial to Decatur County's war dead. In the slanting sunshine, I raise my camera to record these ladies and gentlemen posed against the names of men who died so that young people might dance and promenade. These particular beneficiaries of their sacrifice are blind to the irony.   The photographer has hung a sheet with plastic flowers across the entrance to the gazebo. A couple takes their piace ill front of it while an assistant straightens the boy's tie and smoothes the girl's hair. The assistant steps back, the photographer signals, the couple smiles, and the flash goes off. Another couple replaces them.   By six 0'clock the line is long and the park so full ofparents and grandparents that it is impossible to move. When all of the seniors have had their pictures made, they form a line for the promenade. As each couple's name and the names of their parents is called, they step forward and circle the Confederate soldier much as a bride and groom walk down the isle. When the last couple has promenaded, they go by whatever means they arrived, to dinner, the dance, and breakfast. I am told that the cost for such an evening can exceed six hundred dollars for a young man and his date, almost half a year's after school wages. The crowd in Willis Park disperses, and it is once more a deserted town square.   What will become of these boys and girls in whom I see myself and for whom I feel familiar anxieties? What will come between them and their muse? Which appetites will lift them, which will soil them? Tonight, wrapped in affection and pride, reality is out. Fantasy is in.   Except for a solid and unmoved sentry: the Confederate soldier. He has witnessed on this very ground the suspension of other realities. He stands at parade rest, his marble face limned by the moonlight, his eyes fixed on the east where tomorrow will rise like the curtain on act two.    </Transcription>

    <Transcription>SPE Talk   by   Paul Kwilecki   A talk to be given to the Society for Photographic Education.   Atlanta, GA. November 5, 1994.       SPE TALK @   The first courthouse in Decatur County (1823) was a small log cabin not far from the Flint River. Shortly after it was completed and the first session of court was held, a group of irate citizens, protesting a verdict they did not like, took it down log by log and threw it in the river. Next morning there was only a vacant lot where the new courthouse had stood.   By 1916 taking the law into their own hands was an established alternative that citizens of Decatur County treated as casually as a misdemeanor. The front page of The Post-Searchlight, Decatur County's official gazette, barely took note of a lynching on September 28, 1916:   FOUND NEGRO SWINGING TO LIMB   Passersby on the River Road were surprised Wednesday morning to find a Negro named Schuler hanging to a limb on a tree about five miles from the city. Shuler [sic) has attempted rape on a young white girl in that section and paid the usual penalty. The work was done it seems very quietly and without any excitement. In fact much more orderly than either Ohio or Massechusettets [sic). The body was taken down Wednesday and an inquest held and the incident closed. The matter was talked of a little on the streets of Bainbridge, but there seemed to be nothing undue about the discussion.   This event and others like it were eruptions of the same temperament that caused the first court house to be razed. Excitable citizens in remote, isolated areas like Decatur County were suspicious of courts, legislatures, and the law in general. They mistrusted their power and resented interference in their lives. Their extreme poverty and ignorance engendered a frontier morale. For those whose feelings of impotence made their rage violent, the law, when it acted at all, did not act swiftly or severely enough.   I'm about to show you photographs of Decatur County made over a period of the last thirty-five years.   It's an ordinary rural county located in southwest Georgia. The population is twenty-five thousand ordinary people, and Bainbridge, the county seat, has about half of these. Oak City Cemetery, terminal address of those who formerly walked its streets, lived in its houses, and imparted their vitality to its history, retains in its inventory a former governor of Georgia, a real countess, and a movie star. The rest were ordinary citizens.   In 1959, when I was 31 years old, I decided to test a theory of mine, and Decatur County seemed an ideal model on which to try it. Looking at documentary photographs from all over the world, I was struck by sameness not contrasts. Landscapes, clothing, buildings were different, but that was due to geography. People were the same: their faces reflected the same range of emotions, their store of gestures was the same, and their interior lives were preoccupied satisfying the same demands. The conclusion was inescapable. Human beings struggle compulsively to satisfy a handful of basic emotional needs. Historically poets and psychologists agree: the search for love, understanding, self-respect, and fulfillment goes on wherever there is a single human being.   If this were true, I could bear witness as well in Decatur County as in New York or Tokyo. The problems Decatur Countians face may be unlike the problems of urban Iffe. 'our myths and traditions may differ from those of other cultures, but the individual's need for fulfillment is as urgent yet elusive there as elsewhere. If I could teach myself to take what I saw literally. dust off the sediment of over familiarity, and then carefully examine what is exposed underneath, I would have more raw material than I would know what to do with.   That meant looking at the place where I was born and raised without taking anything for granted. Faces I had known for years would have to be laundered. Streets I had lived in would have to forfeit their associations. Buildings would have to be studied in new light. If this reorientation were possible, I could use Decatur County as a metaphor for the world.   @ Paul Kwilecki 1994   As such it could not be over-simplified or shrunk for cosmetic reasons. Contradictions and ambiguities which are abundant in reality, would have to be prominently noted. Negative reactions would coexist with positive ones, which would disturb the monolithic purity of a shorter, less searching document. The history of photography is full of advocacy statements that, no matter how worthy and how powerful resthetically, remain, as depositions, little more than propaganda. In this dispatch from the front which I was increasingly determined to deliver, the message was the details.   It would be a big order, taking years to accomplish. But that could be an advantage. Working on one project for a lifetime affords continuity, magnitude of scale, and a chance for evolution lacking in lesser projects.   To truly engage this subject an elaborate time frame -the most telling of markers distinguishing documentary photography from photo-journalism -would be necessary. The creative process knows nothing of expediency. We gather data unconsciously every day of our lives. When something triggers a reaction, we reflexively draw on what we have collected. At its best, the response, like a genetic code, contains the sum of ourselves while also rendering specifically the subject's intrinsic meaning.   But it cannot be rushed, and it is no secret that photographers are usually in a hurry. They grab what's in sight, stuff it in their cameras, and are off to greener venues. It rarely occurs to them that hidden behind the facades of a single, small community is more action and truth than an army of photographers could see and record in their lifetimes. Decatur County was, for me, no mere assignment, and there was no deadline short of the grave. This had to be done right.   There were practical reasons to vivisect Decatur County. Working there I could cultivate the prolific possibilities of &quot;home&quot; as an idea or archetype. While one must discriminate between authentic feeling and prejudice, home can be a furnace of enormous emotional energy, placing intuition on a par with rationality. Early on I learned to close my eyes and say, &quot;What comes automatically to mind when I think Decatur County?&quot; then try to catch the images that went at strobe-like speed through my head. The court house, the Flint River, the Trailways Bus Station, the cemeteries, the churches, Willis Park. Each became a series.   At first I was drowning in what was, by lay standards, ordinary people doing ordinary things. I had to learn to skim off the dross. To do that I cultivated local history, patience and visual acuity. I sought to distinguish between the truly banal and that which only seemed banal because it was so familiar. I discovered that the wires connecting people to whatever it is that animates them are visible more often in what is mistakenly referred to as the commonplace. It is anything but a common place, and I scoured it like a hunter, probing and kicking for hidden game.   It would be difficult to overstate the demands of a project like this. I needed to be Edward Weston, Eugene Atget, and August Sander rolled into one. I had to respond to landscapes that were parochial but in their way beautiful, structures that were interesting, even moving, in their practicality but ugly, and, most important, a community of people who went about their daily lives with all the individuality of ants deconstructing a picnic. No one wore a badge saying, &quot;Look closely at me, I am more than meets the eye.&quot; Only an inordinate amount of time and patience stalking and waiting made it possible to penetrate their veneer. Shooting at anything as securely camouflaged by life's disarray as these underpinnings, was presumptuous. But I used observation and feeling instead of deduction, and instead of the world, I used a microcosm to which I was emotionally bound. Only 25x30 miles, Decatur County was more manageable than the globe but still full of mazes and dead ends.   Like all places it was shaped by history and geography. Early Decatur Countian's dependence on land and climate for a meager livelihood made them practical people of sometimes feral temperament. As late as the first decade of this century, shoot-outs took place on the town square, and the last lynching occurred just 58 years ago. The social and religious institutions such insecure communities created, the buildings they erected, and the boundaries that were imposed on their minds and imaginations were necessities of the rural life of their time. They were products of the land as much as any crop they grew. Their concerns were for survival. They lived in daily contact with the elemental threat of extinction. The blessings of science were offset by the curse of an inscrutable economy, which even today is as ominous as drought and insects ever were. Grasping this, I began to better understand not only the place but myself in relationship to it, and my photographic documentation of Decatur County, Georgia became a lifetime probing for origins and meanings. I addressed my work to the spectator who was willing to experience Decatur County emotionally, as an enigma, who could intuitively recognize and evaluate its variegated underpinnings.   A problem I confronted early was how to structure my document to suggest the simultaneity and layering of real life. The community does not exist in isolated fragments like a frame of film nor in frozen time. An essence of reality is violated when the continuity and flow of life is broken in its transfer to a photograph. Remind yourself that activity in the court house goes on simultaneously with work in factories. Prayer meetings overlap shopping, and Sunday picnickers are machine operators on Monday. Every citizen wears many hats, and all the while houses stand looking out on their streets and cemeteries silently wait.   The only thing, I discovered, that can bind each image to its series and every series to the project as a whole is the mind and heart of the photographer: a consistency of seeing -not imposed or contrived but involuntary -in which, no matter the subject, the undercurrent remains the same. It is less something to be developed than something to set free. Willful interference will destroy it; self-consciousness can weaken it. The thing I refer to is nothing as facile as style, which is a clicM and shallow more often than not. What I mean is a kind of purity which, across a photographer's career, is his irreducible essence.   It took several years to arrive at a printing style that was appropriate to what I was photographing. The work of W. Eugene Smith was a strong influence. I admired Smith's dark, luminous prints, and for a year or two I imitated him with painstaking local reduction using potassium ferrocyanide, finally giving it up because its effects were distracting. Smith's work was glorious because of it; mine was pretentious.   I found that there are two options in printing: you can turn the paper itself into a beautiful object, or you can make the surface disappear so that the viewer looks through the print directly at the subject. Paul Strand does the former; Walker Evans does the latter. My work needed the latter, and considerably more. It had to be totally self-effacing. Understatement and ingenuousness were essential. Any suggestion of self-consciousness or manipulation, any prettiness, would not only shatter the illusion, it would be a betrayal of the subject matter.   I could not use the stereotypical brilliant&quot; print. To be faithful to the beautifully soft light of Decatur County, the challenge was to capture but separate as many tonal gradations as possible. Middle grays were especially important. I didn't want brilliant whites or overly rich blacks; just enough whites and blacks to establish the scale. Ironically, my prototype was not original prints at all but Gravure reproductions in first editions of Cartier-Bresson's The Decisive Moment and Les Europeans. They were far more evocative than his original prints which I later saw.   Real technique, however, has little to do with cameras, film, paper, or chemicals. Fortunately, patience and dissatisfaction are all that is needed to master the mechanical side of the medium. Compared to music, for example, photography is an idiot's delight. The technique that we should concern ourselves with is how we handle our subjects, especially people.   Throughout my career I have depended entirely on my subjects to give me what I must have. I can't take it from them or synthesize it out of something else, because I don't know in advance what it is. But they do. If I'm successful at establishing a synergetic, collaborative atmosphere and wait, it's usually forth-coming. My job is to recognize it and press the button. The subjects do the work.   Documentary photographs are not made in a vacuum. In their pursuit one is exposed to a variety of lives, events, and circumstances, most of which have the capacity to instruct and expand the photographer.   On a Sunday morning in 1977 I photographed a baptism at the Flint River in Bainbridge. When I arrived, about fifteen minutes early, I was told that the service would be delayed slightly because the minister's eighteen year old son had just died. I presumed another minister would take Rev. Mitchell's place. But Rev. Mitchell showed up, barely late. I went to him and said under the circumstances I'd take pictures another time. His response was, &quot;Stay and take your pictures.&quot; We moved down by the water, and Rev. Mitchell lead the group in a hymn. Then he preached. He began slowly, with uncertainty, but as he went on he got his bearings and his voice grew stronger. He was utterly gripped by what he was saying, and I couldn't help observing that his concentration had made him forget for a moment what would otherwise be lurking in the background for the rest of his life. After the preaching he and Ben Edwards walked into the water and performed the baptism. I then went to Rev. Mitchell and told him how impressive he was, how confident he seemed. He looked at me patiently as though I were a child in his Sunday School class to whom he must explain something that was too complicated. He said that his son was loaned to him, not given. Now God wanted him and he was in a better place. He would miss him, but he would see him again some day. It was said quietly, at a time most fathers would be suffering the agonies of the damned. This was not, for once, faith that could be falsified. I saw his eyes. It was faith assimilated and tested in the severest way, and I will never forget it.   A footnote on the ineluctable course of fate: twelve years after the baptism, the child I photographed had become a drug addicted adult and was raped and murdered in the small hours of the morning on a deserted street, a recapitulation of violence that has been with the community since its beginning. Ironically Rev. Mitchell performed her final rites and most of those who had attended her baptism were at the funeral, myself included. I looked at the picture of her as a child being led from the water and was confounded by the photograph's ignorance of her destiny. Only a camera could have seized the innocence of that moment; the future made a mockery of it.   Photographing in local factories for my series on workers of Decatur County, I learned that many jobs require extensive editing of self. An employer buys only that part of a person which is needed for a specific job, and he views the remainder as a liability: he doesn't want it on the premises. Many of the workers, on the other hand, view their jobs with little interest beyond salary: eight hours devoted to paying for the other sixteen. I overheard a beautiful woman of about forty telling her friend that her clock failed to go off and she was almost late. She said she grabbed a quick shower and left her bed unmade. I pictured her rooms: the crumpled sheets, water dripping from the shower head, a bar of soap melting in the soap dish, and the erotic fragrance of a fresh scrubbed woman settling over the place. She had left her essence behind in her carapace: what I saw in the factory was merely the little organism that lived inside, and she would become whole again at five o'clock. In my photographs of factory and farm workers I tried to suggest that whole person.   The religions of Decatur County is another important series. I pursued it intensely for the better part of three years and have returned to it subsequently on several occasions. I was completely mistaken in my pre-conceptions of the Pentecostal religions. At first I was intimidated by the dancing and singing, but I quickly saw that it is a spontaneous expression of joy. Mainline churches, for whatever reasons, have made religion menacing. The contrast between the informality of the Pentecostals and the stiffness of other churches explains much of the current popularity of the Pentecostal approach.   These are experiences that have enriched and informed my life decisively, and photography made me a gift of them. I consider them more valuable than pictures.   To most people and by any objective appraisal, Decatur County is languid and flat. The previous generations who created it could barely afford to be expedient, much less stylish. Most photographers would decide from a superficial assessment that there was little to photograph. But in important ways Decatur County is the perfect artifact and documents the quality and values of our predecessor's sojourn. The challenge is to see beyond the mediocrity, to their stamina and determination to derive from the fact of being alive nourishment for body and soul. They may never have attained everything they promised themselves, but the community itself is evidence of their struggles. _   The instinct to survive and illuminate something or someone, to have a moment of two of grandeur, to extract a little peace and self-respect from the chaos of everyday life, are the quests that haunted them as they do us. They, like us, had stringently limited resources.   As I look back on my project, I am surprised to find how much like our ancestors we are. My document, for example, belongs solidly to the thirty-five years in which it was made. I could not produce the same body of work today. Both subjects and photographer have been swept away. Given the changes brought about by technology, economics, and politics, it is certain that the message would be altogether different.   Of course this is as it should be. The job of the documentary photographer is to record exigencies of the times, not to wrap everything in his own static personality. The most poignant photographs are those that contrapose our search for understanding, love, fulfillment, self-esteem, against the very distractions and confusions of life which obscure them. To achieve that level of expression, the photographer must be securely himself, entrenched in his own times.      </Transcription>

    <Transcription>My Publishing Experience   Paul Kwilecki   A talk to be given at the High Museum of Art   April 30, 1994       My Publishing Experience   Is publishing worth it?   An experienc~d speaker would withhold a final answer to that question until the last paragraph of his talk. As a photographer, I best give you my answer now and the reasons for it in a series of snap-shots and flash-backs.   Speaking for myself, given my personality and the kind of photographs I make, publishing with commercial or institutional presses is worthwhile and not overly time-consuming. My experience with self-publication was not good, and I wouldn't do it again under the same circumstances. But I think I have learned enough in the process -about myself and the relationship between photography and publication -that I can't be altogether antagonistic or rule out selfpublication as a necessity at some point in getting more of my document before the public.   Photography in my life is like Jehovah: demanding and jealous but supremely nourishing. If I could I would do nothing but photograph. Publication, itself an enigma, Is a form of marketing, and marketing of all kinds is a distraction Jehovah doesn't suffer well. Lowly Wise cost me a year of not photographing, during which I lost an edge that took months to regain.   Example of what I risk loosing: One morning about six weeks ago I walked by the court house and ran into Beecher Thomas. Beecher was my age (66), a street preacher dying of cancer, whom I'd known since he was a delivery boy on a bicycle for Keenan Auto Parts. He'd had chemotherapy and his hair was falling out. Clearly he was seriously ill. He shook my hand and asked me if I had decided to take Jesus as my savior. I said, &quot;No, Beecher, but I sure would like to take your picture. My point is that if I were preoccupied with marketing I might not have seen Beecher even if I passed him, and the adrenaline wouldn't have kicked in when I saw his wasted form laboring in his vineyard to the bitter end, asking about Jesus. I can't let marketing pre.occupations water down recognition or response to my raw material. Beecher died nine days later; it was then or never.   In the best of all possible worlds I could indenture myself to photography without having to worry about exhibition and publication. There would be sensitive, experienced publishers contacting me periodically for my latest work, which I could turn over to them with complete confidence that the photographs would get the treatment they deserved. But... in the real world, as Tevye said, We'll just have to wait for the Messiah.&quot;   I was lucky with my first book, Understandings. Alex Harris at what was then called the Center for Documentary Photography at Duke knew and liked my work. The Center had just obtained funding to publish a series of books, and he wanted mine for the first. With the University of North Carolina Press to design and distribute and Alex to work with me on the selection of the photographs, I got off to a very auspicious start.   Understandings was published in 1981 in an edition of 3000 copies, the 100 photographs printed in 300 line duotone by Meriden Gravure Co., and hardbound. It sold for $24.50. By 1990 about a thousand copies were left which UNC Press sold to a distributor who sold them to book stores for remaindering. I was allowed to purchase the last 100 copies.   It was by no means an impressive record but, I discovered from colleagues who had photography books out about the same time, fairly typical.   There was nothing seriously wrong with Understandings. The problem _was that not enough people were interested in the kind of pictures I make, and those who were were not all reached by the modest university press type advertising campaign. What photography market there is, is largely governed by bellicose entrepreneurs who pillage a well-heeled but esthetically bewildered public. The market for straight photographs that require no intermediary or explanations, only a sense of recognition and identification, is at a nadir.   For several years I went on photographing and putting the pictures in archival boxes, hoping that the future would be more interested in what I was doing than the present.   As both photographs and years continued to pile up and I began to run out of storage space and money, I determined either to publish more of my project or end it. Starting at the top with commercial and university presses, I tried to interest several in a magnum opus. The commercial publishers all said the same thing: photography books are expensive to produce and have a very limited market. Even books by nationally known photographers coordinated with traveling shows in major cities barely break even.   You can't argue with facts, and you can't expect a commercial publisher to take on a project that will loose money. So I turned to the University of Georgia Press. My work is quintessentially Georgia, and university presses are supposed to undertake projects that may not be profitable but should see the light of day nonetheless. Their response that the bogk would be too much like Understandings and wouldn't sell sounded ominously commercial. If profit is the bottom line for university presses, what's the difference in them and the commercial press? That's when I turned to self-publishing.   I could not afford to bring out a large format book with hard back, fancy end papers, five color separations for my black and white photos, and an introduction by Robert Coles. What I might manage was to break my project down into six small books covering the ten most important series. There could be no more than thirty pictures per book, so some books would contain only one series; others would have two.   These books would be designed for the area market, not an art or coffee table market, and their cost would have to be as far below $20 as penny-pinching could force it. For a brief moment I considered producing the books myself in small quantities on my computer. Then I found out what a good scanner and a 2400 d.p.i. or better laser printer would cost.   My most damaging naivete was an enthusiastic assumption that the. freedom to select and sequence the pictures and write the text without &quot;interferencew from an editor or designer was a rare creative advantage. In practice it was the freedom to fall from the highwire without a net.   After deciding that Book 1 would be on religion in Decatur County, I spent about three months selecting pictures, editing text, and sequencing. All the while I was searching for a title. I found Lowly Wise in a verse from Milton's Paradise Lost:   Heaven is for thee too high   To know what passes there; be lowly wise:   Think only what concerns thee and thy being.     All pages except the ones with photographs were done on the software I already had and were transferred to a camera-ready disc for the printer.   I solicited bids from eight printers in the southeast and found they varied from $5500 to $22,000 based on the same specifications. I assumed that the more expensive companies knew how to make beautiful books, but more than image quality was at stake. If I paid $22 a book FOB the printer, Lowly Wise would have to retail at about $40. A soft bound book of thirty photographs would not sell in our market at that price. Thinking that if I stuck to the printer like glue I should get reasonably good quality and price, I accepted the low bid from Gandy Printers in Tallahassee, Fla. for 1000 copies. In addition to being low bidder, they were only fortyfive minutes away, a convenience which, in the light of their ineptitude, escalated to a necessity. I didn't know then how deeply this compromise would cut. Gandy was a large commercial printer whose staff perceived photographs as illustrations, nothing more. When I spoke of keeping the shadows open and holding detail in the highlights, they looked blank.   I made the mistake of telling them what I had told the people at Meriden Gravure, that I wanted to preserve the soft quality of the prints themselves. I explained that the light in Decatur County is unusually mellow, I printed for that feeling, and I wanted it to come through on the pages of the book. At Meriden they understood me: at Gandy it was a fatal mistake. The first set of negatives was a disaster. They were mushy and dead. The second try was better but uneven. Then a dark mUddy cloud fell over the third set. Clearly neither they nor I knew what we were doing. I knew what I wanted the pages to look like, but I didn't know how to translate photographic printing values into offset printing. We agreed to reshoot the negatives, and the fourth attempt was a step in the right direction. There were still three or four images that were unacceptable, and they reshot them again.   I studied the proof pages over a week-end: lacking contrast and vitality, they weren't what I hoped for, but they were better than the previous ones, and I was afraid that if we tried something else -since we didn't know what the hell we were doing -they might get worse. It was at that moment I knew that the book I had visualized was not to be. I had two options -other than suicide. I could settle for what we had or scrap the whole project.   Aware that I had become obsessive about the quality of the reproductions, I reminded myself that the content of the book was more important than its production values, and that thanks to the subject and the intensity of the people, it could still be a vigorous account. Documentary photographers must not be seduced by the sybaritic mirages of the publisher's art.   My frustration was not over, however. It was now mid-October, and I wanted books to sell for Christmas. When I picked up the first 250 copies, several pages in every copy had tiny white dots in all the black areas. Gandy guessed that this was due to the drying and stitching process. To cut to the chase, they redid the 250 bad ones, but had to order more paper, which delayed the arrival of the finished books.   Almost everything about the production of Lowly Wise was anxiety-ridden or depressing. But in fairness to you who may be influenced by what I say, I must confess that the underlying fault was mine. A chain of my own decisions lead to disappointment. It Is my nature to plunge Into projects that interest me with over-optimistic confidence and too little-objective planning. have an unjustified faith that passion will pass for experience, which I should know by now It won't. When I established that Lowly Wise would be for our local market, I condemned the book itself as opposed to its contents, to severe compromise. Until I saw the actual pages, I fantasized that I could get a $22 job for $5.   My wife, Charlotte, and I marketed the books. We were able to place Lowly Wise in Books-AMillion in Tallahassee, the High Museum Gift Shop, the Mcintosh Gallery, and Borders Book Store here in Atlanta, the Book Shelf in Thomasville, and three stores in Bainbridge. When the Tallahassee Democrat gave the book a good review In its Sunday edition, Books-A-Million sold out fifty copies that afternoon and continued selling a dozen a week for several weeks.   I developed a mailing list of roughly 500, and obtained a list of all the pUblic and university libraries in the state. I could have placed it with a distributor of independent books, but their terms were impossible: they required a 60% discount, I buy an ad in their catalogue, I pay freight on books shipped to their warehouse, I get paid 90 days after the dealer pays the distributor and not at all if the dealer defaults, I eat all damaged copies, and pay freight on all books returned from the warehouse to me. Right now I'm at the break even point. All potential profit is tied up in unsold copies.   Here's my assessment of Lowly Wise, Book 1. First, what's wrong with it:    	  The quality of the reproductions is mediocre to poor.      	  There is a cell of six images of Mt. Horum Church comparing how it looked when it was in use and how it looks abandoned. I wanted to suggest that institutions no less than people     . are 	ravaged by time. Like individuals, they have their day and are gone. Because the printer was not able to give me the dark, brooding quality that is in the original prints, much of the effect is lost.      	  There are a couple of images I chose over stronger ones for reasons of sequen~ing-how they fit with the picture on the opposite page. I wish I had worked harder to fit the stronger ones in and not worried so much about the co-relationship.       Now what's right with it:    	  It accurately, straightforwardly shows a rich vein of faith, the nature and importance of which is generally underestimated, misunderstood, or dismissed as primitive.      	  For all its physical shortcomings, the book works. It's appearance is in keeping with its contents, form growing out of subject.      	  The writing and the photographs are one -egocentric and inviting interpretation.       The few reviews Lowly Wise received were positive. But I could not interest Georgia Public Television or National Public Radio in a review. I was interviewed on All Things Considered when Understandings came out, but they didn't answer my letters concerning Lowly Wise. A book store in Savannah refused to stock the book because they said it was of local interest only. This misreading of its contents is a danger I f~ce with all my work, published or exhibited. At a glance, my larger thesis, insights from the commonplace, which underlies even my Decatur County subject matter, looks so unpromising and bromidic a viewer may assume that the commonplace is as banal in photographs as it is mistaken for in reality. The distinction, which requires more than a glance, is that in photographs at their best there is a specificity wherein what is barren is weeded out and the image editorializes on itself.   A couple of photographer-friends whose opinions I value were annoyed that captions were at the back of the book, not beneath the images and pictures weren't placed with the writing about them. My answer was that I like to see photographs on a clean page without detracting letter shapes close by or text opposite. If it's necessary for the reader to move back and forth, so much the better. He should contribute something.   Until recently I would have said Lowly Wise on balance was not a success: not a failure but not a success either. Then I went several months without picking it up. An unfrazzled, less gloomy look made me realize that more testimony came through than I first thought. Distracted by the book's compromised execution, I had failed to respect and adequately assess its underlying strengths. I realized that with all its shortcomings it says the right things and is consonant with the values and viewpoint that underlie my entire project. I stand by it.   Books, after all, are representations of photographs, not the photographs themselves, and as a published collection are physically and functionally different. Documentary photographers must understand that their books, widely disseminated, serve as a permanent, indispensible record of life, and with the passage of time the content of the pictures becomes more compelling than their rendering. Historians, sociologists, anthropologists, or even collectors can seek out and study the original prints if their purposes warrant. We must also remember to push against the limitations of the past. New methods of photographing, sequencing, and publishing must be tried, even at the risk of failure. After all some failures are more significant than many successes. If the problem the photographer has set for himself is consequential, even a partial solution can be illuminating and thrilling.   Publishing is a complicated undertaking. In subsuming photography, it poses unique problems in exchange for new possibilities. The knowledge and experience of specialists can be essential. Most of the shortcomings of Lowly Wise could have been minimized or avoided with the advice of a good photography editor and book designer. The lack of this resource and the problems of distribution or marketing are the two major barriers to publishing your own book. One is financial; the other is tactical.      </Transcription>

    <Transcription>GALLERy TALK   I am frequently asked by people who have not seen my work why I spend my life documenting one, simple place like Decatur County, Georgia, population 25,000. People confuse simple with small: they're not the same thing. There are no simple places or simple lives. The problems Decatur Countians face may be different from the problems of urban life, but they are no less threatening and therefore exacting. Fulfillment and self-respect are as necessary but elusive in Decatur County as elsewhere.   Having been born and raised in Decatur County, I was both nourished and wounded by it. I know the place like I know myself. Its landscape and prosaic structures comfort me with their familiarity, like a mother cradling a child. Photographing it is a means by which I can begin to understand the complex of archetypes and emotions we refer to collectively when we talk about home. The place or places in which we spend childhood and adolescence constitute our earliest link with the world outside ourselves and have an enduring effect on our subsequent lives. For that and other reasons it is important to assimilate the institutions, the history, the economy, even the buildings and the landscape as parameters within which we develop.   Decatur County, like all places, was shaped by its history and geography. Early Decatur Countian's dependence on land and climate for a meagre livelihood made them practical people. The social and religious instituti9ns they formed, the buildings they erected, and the boundaries that were imposed on their minds and imaginations were necessities of the rural life of their time. They were products of the land as much as any crop they grew. Their concerns were for survival. They lived in daily contact with the elemental threat of extinction. The blessings of science were offset by the curse of an inscrutable economy, which even today is as ominous as drought and insects ever were. If I grasp these verities, I begin to better understand not only the place but myself in relationship to it, and my photographic documentation of Decatur County, Georgia, becomes a lifetime probing for origins and meanings. Thus I address my work to the spectator who is willing to experience Decatur County emotionally, as an enigma, who can recognize and evaluate its tenuous underpinnings.   To engage such an audience an expansive time scale is required. The creative process knows nothing of expediency. We gather most of our data for creative purposes unconsciously. When something triggers a reaction, we reflexively draw on what we have collected. This response, like a genetic code, contains the sum of ourselves while also rendering specifically the subject's intrinsic meaning.   Recently I was photographing in Willis Park. The high school seniors were having their prom pictures made in front of the gazebo. The boys wore tuxedos or full dress suits, the girls had on long dresses and many carried bouqets of roses. I thought to myself how wonderful that the world, at this moment at least, is a little more stable. Perhaps these beautiful young people won't have to go off to war. (This was before war broke out in the mid-east.) When I printed a shot showing couples lined up on a walkway waiting, I saw above their heads, on a building across the street a sign saying, IfArmed Forces Recruiting.1f One immediately thinks of lines of recruits. I was not conscious the sign was there until later when I saw the photograph, yet it was precisely the device to make my feeling visible.   Real circumstances are richer than anything we can invent, and photographs made from them have unique credibility and economy. When one searches for a specific image, he blinds himself to everything else. He is apt to let a possible photograph pass unnoticed that is better than what he set out to find. For several years I was fascinated by old photographs on grave stones. I carefully sifted every cemetery I knew. One dreary day I was walking through an isolated grave yard in a remote part of the county. Cows were grazing just outside. I passed a monument topped by a marble lamb quietly watching them. It was both droll and because of the light and the misting rain, beautiful. I like the resulting photograph better than any of my pictures of pictures on gravestones.   An early problem was how to structure my document to suggest the simultaneity and layering of real life. The community does not exist in isolated fragments like photographic images nor in frozen time. An essence of reality is violated when the continuity and flow of life is broken in its transfer to a photograph. Remind yourself that activity in the court house goes on simultaneously with work in factories and on farms. Prayer meetings and church services overlap shopping and the people in church are jurors at the court house. Sunday's picnickers are machine operators on Monday. Every citizen wears many hats, and all the while houses stand looking out on their streets and cemeteries silently wait.   I decided to organize the photographs into series and try to give each series its own stance or conscience which might in a subliminal way intensify its content. It would not be the flow of real life, but it could be a metaphor for it. I selected my first subjects from landmarks and occupations that came to mind instinctively when I thought of Decatur County: the court house, the Flint river, the bus station, the cemetery, churches, farms, the timber industry. My first series was shade tobacco. The second was Battle's Quarters. Then the court house and bus station. I tried to teach myself to be critical and honest about my pictures, not self-indulgent. If they didn't work I went back and reshot them. Gradually as more series were added I could skip from one to the other. Activities changed with the seasons and the whole place changed with time, so I found myself not only recording activities, buildings, and landscapes, but mysterious, sometimes concealed elaborations.   I found quite early that technique was an indispensable part of expression. I had been bowled over by the work of W. Eugene Smith, especially his stylized, almost Gothic way of printing. I expended--I'm tempted to say wasted, but the time was not wasted--considerable effort trying to learn to print the way he did, only to discover a couple of years later that what I had to say couldn't use his way of saying it. What I needed was technique refined enough to make my prints disappear; not call attention to themselves as prints but let the subject come through unencumbered. I required a certain deception. My material is so ordinary looking it may seem I picked it up out of the dirt I was standing on. To maintain this unselfconscious look, it is sometimes necessary to print for many hours, carefully hiding all signs of manipulation. I must say, however, it is easier to get a good print now than it was thirty years ago. Film and paper are far more forgiving than they used to be.   As the project grew some problems became vexingly abstract. I discovered slowly over a long period of time that while I was making photographs of specific places and individuals, I was also getting from the series a collective sentiment, something stronger and more pointed than the individual images. It was an effect worth striving to enhance. It required an enormous amount of contemplation, both of the photographs in the series and of my affections and sympathies for the material. I tried to gain a sense of what was missing and the direction I should take to properly move forward.   Always the essential element was feeling. I learned that I should photograph only those subjects that mattered. It is easy to get off the main road without noticing. You look at photographs you thought were important when you made them, only to discover with time that they don't work. Of course this may be failure to see well or inadequate execution, but most often I find that I'm not sufficiently involved with the subject. In which case I stop. The subject may be worthy of attention, but for some reason at that moment I can't relate to it.   I once made all the necessary arrangements to photograph at the hospital in Bainbridge. I spent several weeks going there daily. I failed to make one good picture. I broke off for three months, went back, failed again, and realized that I had nothing worthwhile to say. Some day when I am irresistably attracted to the subject--and I'm not talking about personal reactions to illness and death, I'm speaking of those feelings that separate a true involvement from an exercise--I may try again.   This is not the kind of project for just anyone. Decatur County is not exciting or glamorous, and any photographs you derive from it are not likely to make you rich and famous. The desire and energy to continue year after year come from seeing layer on layer of subject matter peeled back before your eyes, material you didn't know existed until you penetrated the layer above. Eventually you realize the supply is inexhaustible, a lesson in itself, and that how much of it you can exploit depends on your patience and skill.   Documentary photographs are not made in a vacuum. In their pursuit one is exposed to a variety of lives, events, and circumstances, most of which have the capacity to instruct and expand the photographer. On a Sunday morning in 1977, I photographed a baptism at the Flint River in Bainbridge. When I arrived, about fifteen minutes early, I was told that the service would be delayed slightly because the minister's eighteen year old son had just died. I presumed another minister would take Rev. Mitchell's place. But Rev. Mitchell showed up, barely late. I went to him and said under the circumstances I'd take pictures another time. His response was, &quot;Stay and take your pictmes.&quot; We moved down by the water, and Rev. Mitchell lead the group in a hymn. Then he preached. He began slowly, with uncertainty, but as he went on he got his bearings and his voice grew stronger. He was utterly gripped by what he was saying, and I couldn't help observing that his concentration--stalwart remedy that it is-had made him forget for a moment what had happened. After the preaching he and Ben Edwards walked into the water and performed the baptism. I then went to Rev. Mitchell and told him how impressive he was, how confident he seemed. He looked at me quite matter-of-factly as though I were a student in his Sunday school class and said that his son was loaned to him, not given. Now God wanted him and he was in a better place. He would miss him, but he would see him again some day. It was said quietly, at a time most fathers would be suffering the agonies of hell. This was not, for once, faith that could be faked. I had looked in his eyes. It was faith assimilated and tested, and I will never forget it.   A sad but enlightening footnote on the unpredictable course of fate: twelve years after the baptism, the child I photographed had become a drug addicted adult and was raped and murdered in the small hours of the morning on a deserted street. Ironically Rev. Mitchell performed her final service and most of those who had attended her baptism were at the funeral, myself included. I looked at the picture of her as a child being led from the water and was in awe of what lay ahead of her. Only photography, with its before and after capability, has the force to make our defenselessness before fate dynamic in precisely this way.   Photographing in local factories for my series on workers of Decatur County, I learned that many jobs require extensive editing of self. An employer buys only that part of a person which is needed for a specific job, and he views the remainder as a liability: he doesn't want it on the premises. Many of the workers, on the other hand, view their jobs with little interest beyond salary: eight hours devoted to paying for the other sixteen. I overheard a beautiful woman of about forty telling her friend that her clock failed to go off and she was almost late. She said she grabbed a quick shower and left her bed unmade. I pictured her rooms: the crumpled sheets, water dripping from the showerhead, a bar of soap melting ,in the soap dish, and the wonderful fragrance of a fresh scrubbed woman settling over the place. She had left her essence behind in her carapace: what I saw in the factory was merely the little organism that lived inside, and she would become whole again at five o'clock. In my photographs of factory and farm workers I tried to suggest that whole person.   The religions of Decatur County is another important series. I pursued it intensely for the better part of three years and have returned to it subsequentlyon several occasions. I was completely mistaken in my pre-conceptions of the pentecostal religions. At first I was intimidated by the dancing and singing, but I quickly saw that it is a spontaneous expression of joy. Mainline churches, for whatever reasons, have made religion inhibiting and sober. The contrast between the casualness of the pentecostals and the formality of other churches was inescapable as was the conclusion that God in pentecostal religion is directly accessible to every worshiper.   These are experiences that have enriched and informed my life decisively, and photography brought them about. I consider the experiences more valuable than the pictures.   To most people and by any objective appraisal Decatur County is aesthetically banal. The previous generations who created it could barely afford to be expedient, much less stylish. Most photographers would decide from a superficial assessment that there was little to photograph. But in important ways Decatur County is the perfect artifact and documents the quality and values of our predecessor's sojourn. The challenge is to see beyond the mediocrity, to their stamina and determination to get from the fact of being alive something they could use.   The instinct to survive and understand something of life, to love and be loved, to maintain a certain dignity, self-respect, and attain some degree of success, at least in our own eyes, motivate us consciously and unconsciously. We have our work, our faith, our social, and our economic constraints to deal with, and it is on one or more of these fronts that our major battles are joined. When I look through my view finder at religion, people at their work, or the court house, I am in pursuit of major themes in which I hope the viewer can see himself as in a mirror. If so my point is made: Decatur County is neither simple nor insignificant. Life there is like life everywhere, and I cannot think of a higher goal than understanding what we can of it.  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>  Duke Talk: October 3, 2001   My father is buried less than a mile as the crow flies from the spot where he was born, married, worked for sixty years, and died. I was born just down the street at Riverside Hospital, have lived in Bainbridge all my life, and will be buried in Oak City Cemetery beside my wife, mother and father, brother, uncles and aunts, my grandparents, great-grandparents and a cousin who survived five Nazi concentration camps.   My love of home, Decatur County, is as old as I am and however deep I am. For nearly forty years I have tried to understand myself through it and photograph it in a way that will clarify the meaning of a place some say has no meaning. But the further I go the more mysterious the place becomes.   The task is complicated. I am one man, one mind, one pair of eyes trying to distinguish what is significant in an entire community. I have to deal with my yes-and-no reactions, which, if set down properly, energize the document, creating an edge and a human dimension. It makes the document more than a catalogue.   Good documentary photography is simultaneously a record of reality and an editorial on that reality. In fiction the author is omnipotent. He deftly hides incongruities so that everything flows into a main theme. It gives his work continuity, and there are no dead ends. But I am making a factual record out of bits and pieces of experience and they are stubborn about bonding to aesthetic standards. Much is lost in translation from reality to photographs of reality, most of it in bringing order to something that is by nature random.   Another problem: how do I suggest the layering, for lack of a better word, of real life? Every day twenty-five thousand lives unfold simultaneously in Decatur County. Men and women get up, go to work, return home, and go to bed. During the time between rising and going to bed they grow into their particularity. One day, one month, one year follows another. The community is never static like a frame of film. This dynamic nature of reality is violated when we transfer it to photographs. Activity at the courthouse goes on simultaneously with work in factories. Prayer meetings overlap shopping, and Sunday picnickers are store clerks on Monday. Every citizen wears many hats, and all the while houses stand looking out on their streets and cemeteries silently wait.   I rearrange sacred furniture. Because my brain, not my camera, is my instrument, beauty isn't enough. I'm looking at subject, not at the surface of the print, though I'm grateful when the surface turns out to be beautiful. Lisette Model said it perfectly: &quot;Concerned for art, subject is lost. Concerned for subject, art is found.&quot; For me, a single print is rarely sufficient. I attach it to subject-related photographs to form a series. The series shows the irony, humor, complexities, and contradictions that life in this specific place is made of. No metaphors, no messages, no symbolism: Decatur County is as real as the map of Georgia, and the people I photograph are the people who live there.   Who could possibly be interested in the lives of anonymous people in an anonymous place? This is the age of celebrity and media, and the noise that they make drowns out everything else. It is difficult for a photographer working outside the public eye to hear himself think. One's mantra must be something like what Bernice Abbott wrote in The World of Atget: &quot;Acclaim is, after all, not the essential reward. The act of creating has its own reward, and it is primary. When one embarks on an uncertain venture, silence is often an ally. Anonymity becomes an asset, if not a necessity.&quot; I knew from the start that making this document would have to be its own reward, because mainstream photography would find the subject matter insipid. Yet, to a perceptive few who recognize themselves in the lives I look at, the series confirm that underneath cultural layers, human beings are alike, and insight into a life in Decatur County is insight into lives everywhere. These are the people I make my pictures for.   About twenty five years ago, the college in Bainbridge invited me to exhibit fifteen photographs during Black Awareness Week. I gave a lot of thought to the prints I would use, finally deciding on pictures from the Shade Tobacco Series and the Battles' Quarters Series. Battles' Quarters was one of several African American slums in town, but surpassed the others in the speed and thoroughness with which it dehumanized its tenants. Residents received welfare checks for not working and for bearing illegitimate children. Men and women adjusted to brutal living conditions in the quarters by foregoing privacy and suspending all concept of time. They sat in groups of four or five in their yards, on their porches, or on their old cars which were big and banged up. They would leave their group to eat, not on a schedule but whenever they were hungry. They might return or go to bed to sleep or have sex with only a thin wall and an open window separating them from the others, or lie on the splintered floor of the porch. Someone else would take their place, so the individuals changed but the group itself remained.   Two hours after the exhibit opened I got a phone call from the president of the college saying he had a committee in his office protesting.   They felt the pictures were demeaning. I assured the president that the opposite was my intention. I meant to show the strength and resourcefulness of people who could live like that yet wake every morning to another day knowing that nothing was going to change. However, I told the president, I would leave a decision up to him. If he wanted to take the photographs down, he could do so. He took them down.   That night I got a call from two faculty members asking me to come next day and explain to the students what I had intended. They warned me that students could get rowdy, but I was determined to make clear the documentary traditions out of which the pictures were made. I stayed up until the small hours of the morning preparing my remarks and sifting through books to find photographs to use as examples. The classroom was full, and I talked for an hour, explaining that at some point in the future when squalor like Battles' Quarters was far behind them, they would want proof of the distance they had come and what they had survived. It was the most attentive, courteous audience I've ever had. When I finished many stayed to ask questions and make comments about the photographs, some of which were by Lewis Hine, Jacob Riis, Timothy O'Sullivan, Matthew Brady, Alexander Gardener, and W. Eugene Smith.   Two years later I was stopped on the street by a member of the committee who had just read an article about my work in the Atlanta newspaper. She apologized saying that the committee had not understood my good intentions. The truth was that they assailed my photographs as a knee jerk reaction and neither she nor the committee understood anything. She apologized on the authority of the Atlanta Journal, but she did not understand.   Mine is an egocentric document, making no claim to comprehensiveness or objectivity. To the contrary, its distinction is that it is a native product, unrestricted by detachment and impartiality. I photograph subjects who are, to me, vivid and substantial. I leave everything else alone.   I hope my work reflects a few essential truths about how Decatur Countians live. We require food and shelter, but equally important we need love, self-respect, some dignity, and, if possible, fulfillment. Watching and responding to the struggle is what I do. If watching means absorbing facts and responding means assimilating them emotionally, perhaps together a measure of understanding is not too much to hope for.   Feeling is one of the highest forms of knowing. Some of our keenest insights are launched by instinct. The seed of my Decatur County project was sewn in 1960 when I saw black workers covering fields by sewing yellow and white cheesecloth to wires that were strung on poles nine feet high. Entire fields became white or yellow. Cigars are made of a core of mixed shredded tobacco, a stiff binder of coarse leaves, and an outside wrapper of thin, silky, even burning shade tobacco. At the end of the nineteenth century, Cubans were growing choice leaves in the shade of their orange and coconut groves. Two American growers saw the advantages and brought back the idea of constructing shades under which one could control the amount of light by manipulating the mesh of the cloth. The land, the crop, and the workers caught my eye immediately. All were beautiful.   The life the tobacco hands lived was as strenuous and physical as life can be. On the inside it was laden with anxiety and frustration. Outside was another story. One morning two large, muscular boys, waiting for their wagon to return from the barn, were wrestling as I walked up. One threw the other down with a thud that shook the ground. Women talking in a group to the side ignored them. Men shooting craps continued their game. When the wagons returned the two wrestlers got up, brushed themselves off, found their hand pallets and went off down adjoining rows laughing and talking about a woman they shared.   Yet beneath their talk and laughter, their quick tempers and their tactlessness, they wore sadness like an insignia. It was not self-pity but world weariness, frustration that nothing more than an accident of birth-their ancestors were slaves-made them expendable. The zeal with which they threw themselves into everything they did whether it were toil or play and a robust sense of humor, along with their stamina, enabled them to endure days of back-breaking work and nights of despair in the subtropical, intensely prejudiced south Georgia atmosphere.   Beneath the shades when both the temperature and humidity hovered around one hundred, I could stand quietly and hear stalks growing six inches in a single night. The farms on which shade tobacco was grown were the last vestiges of ante-bellum plantations. There were quarters for the hands, many of whom grew up in tobacco, their parents having worked it all their lives. Owners took paternalistic responsibility for their welfare. They found work for them when tobacco was out of season, loaned them money, and got them out of scrapes with the law. In the days before Medicare, one farmer I knew paid a very large hospital bill so that the eighty year old wife of one of his hands who hadn't worked in years could have her wish and die on clean white sheets.   In September 1982, nine years after the last shade tobacco had been shipped from the last packing house in Decatur County, I decided to look at what was happening to the farms. I drove south to Fowlstown to one that had been prosperous. As such it had quarters: houses, barely adequate when new, that had become totally unfit with vacancy. One stood separate from the rest with a big fig tree in the front yard. It shaded the porch and provided a family of cats with limbs on which to sun themselves. An old man was sitting in a swing eating his dinner out of a tin plate. He put it down when he saw me. He wore a flannel shirt and hand-me-down trousers many sizes too big. As he rose unsteadily I saw that he was frail and stiff. He shuffled forward, straining through milky eyes to make me out. Seeing him in the sunlight I thought how beautiful this desiccated old man is. &quot;Do you mind if I take some pictures?&quot; I asked.   &quot;I ain't done nothin'. I ain't botherin' nobody,&quot; he said.   &quot;I know. I just want to take your picture,&quot; I said. A big woman who had been listening came out. She said he was afraid I was the law. But go ahead and take the pictures. The door was open and I could see into the front room which was bare except for a sofa by the window and a table. She lead him to it and sat him down. I began taking pictures.   &quot;I ain't done nothin',&quot; he repeated. As I took the pictures-and take is what I did-I knew I was exploiting him. I was synthesizing and reducing him for others, in comfort and leisure, to inspect.   When I finished I thanked him. Either he didn't hear me or had lost interest. He was sitting on the sofa by the open window enjoying the warm sunshine while a cat ate his dinner, which he had forgotten, on the front porch.   On the same farm I passed a house so dilapidated I assumed it was vacant. The front door was on the ground under the sill where the steps had been. Weeds were roof high. Four children, one naked, were trying to ride a single tricycle on the hard dirt. The stench of sour water and garbage was everywhere.   As I got closer I could see a handsome but prematurely old woman with a can of beer in her hand standing in the doorway. Carefully she lowered herself to the ground. &quot;Who you lookin' for?&quot; she asked.   &quot;Nobody particularly,&quot; I said. &quot;I'm a photographer. You live here?&quot;   &quot;Right here.&quot; She drained her beer and looked me over. &quot;You from welfare?&quot;   &quot;No,&quot; I said. She was glaring at me. &quot;That's a hell of a house,&quot; I said.   &quot;You got that right,&quot; she said. &quot;But ain't nothin' we can do but live in it. We ain't even got enough to feed all the grans.&quot; &quot;Where's their father?&quot; &quot;Shit!&quot; she said. &quot;Where's their mother?&quot; She nodded toward the house.   A five year old girl came up and clung to her skirt. &quot;She don't play with the others,&quot; she said. The girl's face was dirty, but her hair was carefully braided in two pigtails. &quot;That's her tricycle,&quot; the grandmother said, &quot;but she don't ride it. They 'bout tore it up,&quot; she said, indicating the other children. She looked down and rubbed the top of the child's head affectionately. For a moment her face softened. &quot;She was in Florida with my sister who got married just 'fore Christmas. Her old man didn't want younguns 'round so they brought her back Christmas eve. Just put her out. I didn't know she was coming and didn't have nothin' for her. It was all I could do to get Sandy Claus for them others. I hated it. I knowed she was going to cry. But she didn't. She just acted like she didn't give a damn. And she's been like that ever since. I got the tricycle from Sears 'bout a week later, but she ain't rode it twice.&quot; The child had released her grandmother's skirt and was standing a few feet away taking in every word.   A thin, much younger woman with long, uncombed hair appeared in the doorway. She had on a filthy housecoat. &quot;Mama, where's the beer?&quot; she shouted. A lean young man in red silk underwear jumped from behind her onto the ground and went into the privy.   &quot;Oh Jesus,&quot; the grandmother said and started toward the house. She tossed her empty beer can, which she had squeezed into an hour glass, beyond the weeds. Her daughter went back inside. The young stud came out of the privy and hopped spryly into the house behind her.   The first courthouse in Decatur County (1823) was a small log cabin not far from the Flint River. Shortly after it was completed and the first session of court was held, a group of irate citizens, protesting a verdict they did not like, took it down log by log and threw it into the river. Next morning there was a vacant lot where the new courthouse had stood. It foreshadowed a tradition of political and social violence that would haunt Decatur County for years, and it would center around courthouses.   The last mob violence in Decatur County took place in 1936. An African American tapping pine trees for gum turpentine raped and slashed to death two white women with a hack-sharpener, a double-bladed instrument used to chip bark. He escaped to Dothan, Alabama but was caught hiding in an attic. Our sheriff sent four deputies to bring him back. On their return, just inside Decatur County where the deputies were sovereign, the prisoner tried to escape, or so the deputies swore, and had to be shot. His body was taken to Tom Bynes's Funeral Home. A mob gathered, entered the funeral home, took the body, tarred and feathered it, dragged it around Willis Park-the lady in the ticket booth at the Ritz Theater which faced the park never forgot the frenzy-then took it to the Negro ballpark on Webster Street and strung it up over a bonfire. The deputy who proudly owned up to having fired the shot that killed the prisoner was elected sheriff a few years later and held office until he was stabbed to death by the husband of his mistress.   I was drawn to the courthouse as a subject because it is inherently dramatic, and because it is where politics gets down to the individual. No matter how much newsprint and air time is spent on politicians, it isn't until the laws they enact make contact with you and me that we feel the yoke of government. The courthouse pictures show Decatur Countians entangled, for whatever reasons, with the law as the voice and policeman of society. The building's institutional coldness and its clumsy hulking scale that dwarfs the human figure, strike at the vulnerability of people, producing an atmosphere of estrangement that can be read on the faces of all who go there. In its most authoritative mode, the courthouse is where one may enter a free man and exit a prisoner. The collective will of society, euphemistically called justice, can fall like a sledge hammer.   As the Courthouse Series is about civil life, the Churches of Decatur County is a series about spiritual life. The emphasis is on people not structures-in this case, the smaller, poorer congregations. To me church buildings are of interest when they bespeak the intensity of the people who built them; when they reflect the virility and passion of their faith, and when they show how poverty can turn less into more.   Straightforward worshipers and unceremonious preachers are my concern. Mainline religions approach the Almighty through ritual and protocol. My subjects speak to God directly in the vernacular. Energy fires back and forth between congregation and preacher like a tennis volley between two champions. The sanctuary can be awash with gestures, shouting, strutting, and perspiration.   But a word of caution; if you're a spectator in what is essentially not a spectator sport, tread lightly and don't jump to conclusions. Grant the premise that between minister and congregation shouting is not shouting but entreaty to God and that dancing is the human body under siege by the holy spirit, neither of which should make more demands on one's imagination than the sacraments at any communion table. My interest has always been in these specialized forms of worship with their roots in a different culture, the product of fertile if sometimes desperate imaginations. When I remarked to a Pentecostal friend that most religions teach that God is king and man his subject, he said, &quot;I think of God as my father. I am his child. A king is feared and served, but a father is loved and trusted and looks after his children.&quot;   Documentary photographs are not made in a vacuum. In their pursuit one is exposed to a variety of lives, events, and circumstances, most of which have the potential to inform and expand the photographer. On a Sunday morning in 1977 I photographed a baptism at the Flint River in Bainbridge. When I arrived, I was told that the service would be delayed because the minister's eighteen year old son had just died. I presumed another minister would take Rev. Mitchell's place. But Rev. Mitchell showed up on time. I went to him and said that under the circumstances I'd take pictures another day. He said, &quot;Stay and take your pictures.&quot; We moved down by the water, and Rev. Mitchell lead the group in a hymn. Then he preached. He began slowly, with uncertainty, but as he went on he got his bearings and his voice grew stronger. He was utterly caught up in the occasion, and I thought how rising to his duty to his congregation had made him, for a moment, forget this grief that was going to haunt his life forever. After preaching he and Ben Edwards walked into the water and performed the baptism. When I told Rev. Mitchell afterwards how impressed I was, he looked at me as though I had missed the point entirely. He said that his son was loaned to him, not given. Now God wanted him and he was in a better place. He would miss him. But there was no separation. He would see his son again. I saw for myself his calm steady eyes and the set of his jaw. It was faith assimilated and tested in the severest way, and I will never forget it.   A footnote on the waywardness of fate: twelve years after the baptism, the child Rev. Mitchell baptized had become a drug addicted adult and was raped and murdered before daylight on a deserted street, a recapitulation of violence that has been with the community since its beginning. Ironically Rev. Mitchell also performed her final rites and most of us who attended her baptism were at the funeral. I looked at my photograph of her as a child being led from the water and felt betrayed by its refusal to warn me of her destiny. The camera caught her innocence; time and circumstances made it mordant. To me this is what documentary photography is about.   Another extensive series is devoted to the laborers of Decatur County. The United States inherited from its Puritan settlers the idea that work is ennobling, a concept that went unchallenged until recently when a combination of technology and the collapse of the moral establishment shot it out of the saddle. Still, a job is the center of gravity for most Decatur Countians who live at least a third of their lives in the workplace. I wanted to find out if we are the same people in the dust and heat of the fields or the noise and tumult of the factory as we are in our beds at night. Photographing men and women on the job was a way of discovering if the essence of one's personality is somehow immune to inimical work environments. One would expect that good workers take only their skills to work, leaving the rest of themselves at home. Yet the reality is otherwise. Watching and talking to them one gets a sense of the whole person: lively, curious, ready to talk about themselves, families, their problems, and each other. Their animated faces imply rich but not necessarily happy lives outside the farm or factory where they are breadwinners for eight hours. For the other sixteen they are parents, lovers, shoppers, worshipers, or defendants, and they never entirely leave these other parts of themselves behind.   The Willis Park Series depicts forty years in the life of a public park. Willis Park is one square block in the middle of downtown Bainbridge, at the center of which is a statue of a Confederate soldier. Looking resolute and wise, his rifle at parade rest, he gazes east toward tomorrow and the future. Originally intended as a cryptogram for segregation and a menacing extension of the courthouse, he has witnessed shoot-outs, political rallies, lynchings, patriotic celebrations, itinerant preachers, and, most recently, the Junior-Senior Proms. He has seen businesses come and go, the truck replace the mule, and thousands of funeral processions on their way from the churches of Bainbridge to Oak City Cemetery.   The soldier stood patiently while the elder W. W. Taylor, a part time preacher without a congregation, spent Saturday afternoons on a wooden Winchester gun shell case in lieu of a pulpit, and for an hour and a half rendered his egocentric vision of reality. He rarely had an audience except for passersby, but for him there was joy in just preaching.   Mercer Baggs killed John Hunter right before the soldier's eyes. They were partners in a furniture business, had an argument, and vowed to shoot each other next time they met. It happened early one morning on the sidewalk directly in front of the soldier. Baggs dropped to one knee, took careful aim and fired. Hunter shot from a standing position and was killed on the spot. Baggs sustained a minor flesh wound, was taken to the Bon Air Hotel across the street and patched up. He walked home.   The soldier may even recall when, in 1918, R. H. May, a cashier in the Citizen's Bank &amp; Trust Co. across Water Street, shot and killed Mr. Richardson in the bank. Richardson was a contractor and had the First Baptist Church under construction. In a packed courtroom within a hundred yards of the soldier, May was given eighteen years. He served eighteen months and got a reprieve. He moved to Florida, went into business, shot his partner, and died before he could be tried.   During the last four decades the soldier has gone from being an imperative reminder of the violent past to a harmless relic. Today he looks down on weddings in the gazebo, candidates for public office, the Junior-Senior Prom, and a wide variety of community activities without so much as a tear for the good old days of racism and savagery.   There are other series: Cemeteries, terminal address of those who formerly walked the streets of Decatur County, lived in its houses, and imparted their vitality to its history; Stores and Shoppers in which customers look like stalkers and stores appear as a claustrophobic's nightmare; the Flint River, a series that illustrates the use to which the county's greatest natural resource has been put; the Trailways Bus Station; and Carnivals, to name a few others.   All began with curiosity and grew as I was led by instinct, sentiment, and the idea of a photographic journal. The whole undertaking is a safari into the jungles of life. I don't make pictures to decorate walls. I make them to shed light in dark corners. When I look through the Viewfinder, the place where I was born and raised doesn't look like the place where I was born and raised. Putting a frame around it, makes a difference, forces choices: what to include and what to exclude, which neutralizes the numbing familiarity hanging over the place. Life in Decatur County becomes life, specific, vigorous, and universal. People work and play, have families, live by community standards, attend to their spiritual needs, and die. New Decatur Countians are born. The images, as they come out of the camera, arrest, clarify, and sharpen what the eye sees only in homogenizing motion. Collectively and at their best the photographs are more than a laundry list of activities. Some are beautiful in the way they tell the truth, a few are funny, but, as Bruce Payne a former lecturer here at Duke wrote, they &quot;...make us pause and wonder, and recognize how much richer and more complicated the world is than any of the things we say about it.&quot;  </Transcription>

    <Transcription>Interview with Paul Kwilecki (Bainbridge, Georgia 12/28/94)   Tucked neatly away by forests and fields, Bainbridge, Georgia, the seat of Decatur County is a quietly bustling community with a nice, red brick downtown and a real sense of community. Here, documentary photographer Paul Kwilecki has etched out his life and his lifelong project, weaving the two together to capture the life of the town and its surrounding areas and the lives of its inhabitants on film and in print with resounding immediacy. With no deadline short of the grave, Kwilecki continually contributes to his document records of community events--parades, picnics, flea markets, carnivals, river baptisms and other church services--as well as places like the Flint River, and people like Mrs. Lily Tomlinson, whom he captured reading dilligently in a food packing plant called the House of Tomatoes. Meeting with Mr. Kwilecki at his studio in downtown Bainbridge, he began by asking this question.   PK Why do you think Southernness interests people so? It does, it fascinates them, especially those from other regions. It seems such a futile, useless enterprise to waste time trying to identify and delineate something that really only exists on an abstract level anymore. In the days before the Civil War when the agriculture and the life that that agriculture created was still intact, you could say that that way of life was distinctively regional. You could pinpoint some things, but now, it's all homogenized, I mean I can show you a McDonalds or a Kmart here that looks like a McDonalds or a Kmart in Seattle or Indianapolis. Architectural styles have become homogenized. Back in the early days of the South, the agriculture also helped to create certain architectural styles, and these were recognizable, representing something that could be isolated and interpreted. But that's not the case anymore. Only in abstraction, and what purpose does that serve? Does that really help us to understand Faulkner, Welty, Thomas Wolfe or anybody else in the South? I get very impatient with people who hold the mistaken idea of some romantic center to the culture of this region that nobody has been successful at putting their finger on. I don't think there is a center. Afterall, those kinds of things are almost self-invented anyway. I mean they don't exist in nature--Southernness, whatever one might choose to say that means, can't be located out there. This is a Southern town geographically, yes, but you can't go out there and show me anywhere in this town a concrete example of Southerness. It seems that people waste an awful lot of time thinking about something like that. I think that if an artist, I hate that word, but a person making literature or images or whatever, if he starts thinking about that, I think he's going to get downright stuck, because he's got to work unself-consciously responding to his own point of view on things. If he starts worrying about influences or the culture of the community in which he is working and so on, he can set himself back a long way.   PJB To get this personal view, you must have become quite intimate with the subjects contained in your photographs. How long did some of these images take to evolve, and how do they reflect the unself-conscious response you speak of earlier? Also, could you tell me how you get into some of these situations?   PK I don't know how much you have ever read of what I've said or what I do. But I only photograph Decatur County. I have devoted my entire life to documenting life here. The familiarity with potential subjects is one of the great advantages of staying in one place.   You wanted to know how I get into some of these situations. Having lived here all my life, I know most of the people. Because I live here and am not a foreigner or an alien who's here today and gone tomorrow, people trust me a little more, so I make some of my contacts, and I go and get permission to attend a particular ceremony or other event. I explain very frankly what I'm doing--that these pictures are not polemical and they're not propagandistic, they are just simple records of what it's like to live here in this community, at this specific time, and that they will take on value in the future for people who are interested in looking back and seeing, as well as reading about, how we lived and what our problems were. This is understandable to most anybody. I have never been rejected when I was trying to get to shoot something. Most of the time they are just wonderfully generous and say, &quot;go ahead, take your pictures.&quot; In my book Lowly Wise, I tell about some of that.   There's a passage about a Mt. Zuma baptism that relates that sort of thing. Most photographers, itinerant photographers anyway, come into a place and they hurriedly gather up everything that's on the surface--click, click, click, click, click, click. As soon as it appears that they have exhausted this community, they move on to somewhere else, whether they're on an assignment or they're doing it for some purpose of their own. The truth of the matter is, the real nuggets are buried and have to be dug for.   Last month, I gave a talk to the Society for Photographic Education in Atlanta. In it I addressed that very point: &quot;It rarely occurs to them (the itinerant photographers) that hidden behind the facades of a single, small community is more action and truth than an army of photographers could   see and record in their lifetime. Decatur County was for me no mere   assignment, there was no deadline short of the grave&quot; (notes from talk). If you stay in one place, instead of skidding across the surface of the material, you penetrate down into it, where the rich deposits are.   Lowly Wise is incidentally one of six books that I'm in the process of doing on the culture of Decatur County. That's just the first one on religion; each one will deal with a different aspect of the culture. The book was produced for the local market.   (Referring to a series of photographs of a church in Lowly Wise)   This is the church after it has fallen into disuse. This is that church when it was in use. This is the church's interior when it was in use, and this is it, a number of years later, when it's been abandoned. They left all that stuff in there. (Turning to another photograph) This is the church when it was in use.   I was trying to make a statement that the church is no less than an individual. They have their day, and then they are gone; not just churches, but institutions of all sorts. No matter how vital and powerful they may be at one time, they reach a zenith and then they go down. That's just in the cycle of reality, I mean, things as well as living organisms have a life and a death, and that's what that little set of pictures was about. I'm not sure that I was wise to put it in there because I'm not sure if that point is of that much interest to people, but it interests me. I was doing the book myself, so I did it the way I wanted.   PJB I'm interested in your work how and what activities you select to photograph, and how you go, photographically, between these various activities. I've seen a variety of your photographic series; they're categorically filed apart from one another--the courthouse images, the fair or carnival images, or the solemn church scenes and baptisms. Any comments on how you feel about moving between such different types of community activities, and more, how do they form a whole Decatur County for you?   PK You see, my business differs from yours in that you can hypothesize in words, or describe and create situations. I can only photograph what's really there. While I do make some photographs of places, it isn't really for aesthetic reasons at all, aesthetics is only a tool as far as I'm concerned. I'm not an artist, I'm not making pictures for aesthetic statements, I'm making them for information. Early on, I asked myself, being a native of this place, &quot;what comes to mind when I close my eyes and think 'Decatur County.' What images rush through it?&quot; The courthouse was one of them, the Flint River was one of them, Willis Park, shade tobacco specifically, agriculture in general, but specifically shade tobacco which is no longer grown here, and a number of others. I started out with a few series, but shade tobacco was really the first.   At first, when I was starting a series, I did work almost exclusively on that series until it reached a certain size. And when it reached a certain size, or my interests were beginning to wane and shift to something else, I would go to that something else. After about six or eight, maybe ten years when I had seven or eight series going, I could take pictures of a number of things and fit them into those series. But at the same time, I can cut across boundaries. For instance, I once, for a small exhibition, did a series that never really existed before called &quot;Women of Decatur County.&quot; I just took pictures from the Courthouse series or the Workers series over here or Willis Park over here, or Flint River--women fishing for example--and just assembled 20 to 25 pictures of women doing different things. So, I don't have to stick rigidly to the prescribed series. Just because of the way in which they were conceptualized doesn't mean that that's the only way they can be put together.   PJB It begins to sound as if now that you have those categories or series established after building them up over the years, each photograph taken either starts a new series or fills in already existing ones. Are any of the series close-ended?   PK The Trailways bus station is an interesting, yet terminal series. It's not a long series, there's probably 20 images in it. And now, we don't have a Trailways bus station; well they do, they have a filling station over in west Bainbridge that the bus stops at, but the bus station that I photographed is no longer there. I considered that one of the few terminal series. Most of the others are open-ended. If there's something going on at the courthouse that I thought was germaine I could walk over there right now and add those to that series.   Sometimes, series rejuvenate themselves. About a year or two ago, I became fascinated with--the cemeteries of Decatur County is a series--I became fascinated with plastic flowers and containers, plastic in the cemetery because it seemed to me that plastic is kind of permanent. The idea of permanent flowers on a grave starts all kinds of wheels turning and suggestions going through your mind. There is the tradition of putting fresh flowers or potted plants that have to be tended, but there are so many graves that are neglected; you can go to them and see that someone has put   a plastic flower there five years ago. It's delapidated, it's faded and falling   apart. It doesn't die like living things die but it has its own death. Overall, I became very interested in plastic flowers on the grave. So I revisted 30 or 40 vicinity cemeteries and these flowers were there when I was originally there, but I didn't see them because I was looking for other things. I was blind to what else was there, so I went back and produced, I think, a set of very unsentimental and interesting pictures taken from a slightly eccentric point of view. That's a case of a series getting a fresh shot of blood, so to speak. As I've said, there are not too many terminal series--I'd say the Trailways bus station, and it's only terminal because they closed it, and the tobacco series, of course, is terminal because there's no more shade tobacco grown here, but most of them are open-ended.   PJB I'm not familiar with shade tobacco, what exactly is it?   PK Shade tobacco was the leaf used to wrap the cigar. You know a cigar, unlike a cigarette, has a tobacco wrapper not a paper one. Shade tobacco was the leaf used to wrap the cigar. It had to be perfect. If you've ever tried to smoke a cigarette that had a hole in the wrapper you know that you can't draw on it. So every leaf had to be perfect; there couldn't be any holes in it. The whole crop was grown by hand. It was a very expensive crop to grow. It was grown under cheesecloth shades. My next book in this series is on the workers of Decatur County. I have an essay in the book on shade tobacco in which I tell all the details. But, basically, it was the wrapper of the cigar. What put us out of business was the minimum wage law and then the homogenized wrapper. They learned how to chop up the tobacco and compress it into a sheet, then cut the sheet up for the wrapper. This process was cheaper. It is such a labor-intensive product that the old way became too expensive. Now, they are growing shade tobacco in Honduras and some other Caribbean islands and we just can't compete. But shade tobacco was only ever grown in the United States in a small area of Decatur and Gadsden counties here, and a small area in Connecticut, near Hartford.   PJB I never really thought of the wrappers being a different type of tobacco, but referring back to some of your terminal series. The passage of time must be an interesting one to you and your work. In terms of Decatur County, you've obviously have seen quite a bit of change. Do you try to capture the progression of time, the way things have changed?   PK I know you probably want me to speak off the cuff, but I've addressed so many of these issues in print where I have distilled my thoughts. This is a catalog of a show I just had at Lehigh University. There's an interview in here with the curator. He asked almost the same question, and there's my answer (pointing to the catalog):   To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, what we call progress is too often merely change. True progress takes place in the human heart. I have seen much change but little progress in my sixtysix years. Naturally old buildings are torn down and new ones erected. Old Decatur Countians die and new ones are born. That's the kind of change photography is uniquely qualified to chronicle, and because it can be very powerful, I use it whenever I can. But it is change, not progress. 1 PJB That's another interesting part of your work, the writing of the accompanying texts. It's very unique in contemporary documentary photography.   PK What I'm trying to get over, to communicate doesn't all lend itself to visual images. As I said before, I'm not trying to make aesthetic images. I'm not in it as an artist; therefore, my interest goes beyond the visual. I'm interested in what is going here, what is happening. You get these people, like in this baptism photograph from Lowly Wise. This is a little, mildewstained, concrete block vat that they built, surrounded by weeds and lit by a hundred watt lightbulb. This is a vessel of salvation? I mean, these people bring somebody out and dunk them in the water that they put in there and they come up a different person. That interests me. I'll show pictures of it, I'll write about it; I'll do anything I can to tell you, or anyone that's interested, what I saw and what my reactions and feelings about it were. I don't say I'm right about it necessarily; I don't really interpret it, but, pictures alone aren't enough to get the whole experience across. There are photographers, for whom I have great respect, that are satisfied solely with the visual image. That's great, I wish that visual images were sufficient for me, it would be a lot easier. I'd rather take a beating than write. To me, writing is the hardest work I know. I sit at that darned computer and just beat my brains out trying to get the simplest idea down, accurately, the way it really was, so that by reading it someone can feel, as well as intellectually grasp, what went on. It takes both writing and the visual image. So, I write about an event, photograph it. If there was some way to capture the odors and everything else, I'd do that too. I respond to odors very strongly. They can just set me off to remembering all kinds of things PJB I've read that smell is the strongest sense.   PK It certainly is for me.   PJB If someone could invent some sort of machine to record and reproduce smells.   PK Yes, like a camera for visual images, something that could capture odors.   PJB Much of your work is divided between black and white population. Any comments, not necessarily on &quot;race relations,&quot; (Kwilecki laughs) but on going back and forth between the two cultures. How do you feel about that?   PK Well, I think I can answer your question, I know what you mean, I think ... I'm at the end of my project now. I mean I'm 66 years old, and I'll continue as long as I live or as long as I am physically able. But, basically, it's said, it's done. I could not go back and remake the early part of the document, or maybe not even the middle part because politics, economics, race relations have all changed. The second series I started was &quot;Battles' Quarters.&quot; Battles' Quarters was a terrible ghetto over in west Bainbridge that was two streets lined with the worst houses you've ever seen. They were built for lumber mill workers back in the late 1920s and early 30s. The lumber mill closed after World War II, and the houses just fell into terrible disrepair. People were living in squalor. I spent two years going over there almost everyday, photographing. Those people accepted me. They got to know me or paid no attention to me. Some of them were very friendly; none of them were hostile. Now, it has been torn down, but, even if it existed, I wouldn't think of going over there.   We've got gangs here in Bainbridge. They just murdered a guy, harmlessly walking down the street. They beat him and beat him until he was unconscious and they took him and picked him up and drove his head into the ground. He was dead. Coming back around to what I was just saying about going back and redoing the early part of the document, things now are just totally different, so therefore, the message of my work would be different. The message in my work, as it stands, whatever else it is, is compassion. And I have said this publicly in talks I have given, so I think it could be defended. I don't feel that compassion anymore toward that element of the public. As far as black and white goes; personally, it makes no difference. It isn't a racial thing, it's an economic and a political one. I'm not interested in photographing gangs. Even if I could do it safely I would not be interested. It isn't the kind of thing that appeals to me.   What really got me started was that these people, the black tobacco workers, the black people that lived in Battles' Quarters, and lots of others, were people of enormous vitality and durability. They could get up and face another day with little to look forward to. I tried to capture this vitality and durability in the very best light that I could, and I did. If you look at my tobacco workers, or the Battles' Quarters pictures--they are extremely sympathetic pictures. But, the people that work tobacco now, or the people who would be living in Battles' Quarters if it still existed, would not arouse my sympathy at all. They are people who live on welfare, who don't work, who avoid their responsibilities, who go out and sire children with no intention of being parents to them. I'm sorry, I'm not sympathetic to that.   It's not a matter of black and white--there are plenty of whites that do the same thing. This is a matter of change having come about that would not allow me to produce the same work today that I did thirty years ago.   PJB Thus reinforcing your idea of change without progress.   To illustrate his point, Kwilecki showed me several images included in his first published collection, Understandings from the Battles' Quarters and tobacco worker series.   PK You see, they were having a conversation, totally ignoring me. That's a shade tobacco shack, that's shade tobacco. Look at the beauty of those people. There's a poise and a beauty about them. This is Battles' Quarters, but you wouldn't see that sort of thing these days.   PJB Was your book Understandings one of the first to come out of Duke's Center for Documentary Studies?   PK Yes, it was the first one they published. You know, the Center for Documentary Studies and the Reference library at Duke acquired my archive about three to four years ago. They took four hundred, forty four prints at that time. I add new work to it each year. They also have my correspondence relating to photography. At the time of my death, they will get the negatives although they will not get the copyrights or control of the material. If for instance my work is wanted for use in some magazine or some gallery wanted to exhibit it, my executor will authorize them to deliver such and such negative to such and such a person/publication for that purpose. But the prints are being stored archivally, and the negatives will be. They will also get my printing sheets, and then they will get the remainder of my correspondence.   They are building there at Duke what will be a very important collection of Southern material. The librarian said that fifty years from now, a scholar doing research on just about any subject relating to the South will have to make at least one stop at Duke.   PJB So when did you start taking photographs, or how did you really start, the first couple of rolls. How did you start? Obviously, the value of your work has accumulated in various stages, but in the first pictures that you took, did you have your project in mind or were you just fiddling around?   PK Well, I was only eight years old; I didn't know what a project was (chuckles). I got a developing kit for my eighth birthday. It was one of these little things; it all came in a box about six inches by one foot and it had little trays, and three little packets of chemicals and a little frame for contact printing. You took the film--I had a box camera and it used film that was about two inches wide--and, in the dark, you took it and put a clip in each end of it and put it in the tray with the developer in it for five minutes or however long. Then you drained it and removed it from there.   I can remember, when you unrolled the film off of the spool it just wanted to twist up. To get that damn thing straightened out and keep it straight so you could run it through the developer, what a job that was. just fell in love with the whole thing. You made contact prints, and ever after I loved photographs.   In high school, I shot pictures for the yearbook; and and when I was at Emory, a friend of mine and I started our own little sort of magnum photo agency. We had something published in Life magazine. You know, Life used to do these &quot;Life goes to a party,&quot; &quot;Life goes to this and that.&quot; The KA's (Kappa Alpha) had their, I don't know, their fiftieth anniversary or something in Atlanta. The KA's used to celebrate their connection with the Confederacy. They all dressed up in Confederate uniforms and marched down to the capitol, and they had somebody, the governor, who came out and made a speech. Then they had a big ball that night and so forth. My friend Charlie and I had covered it. We had in mind sending it to Life. We did and they ended up using part of it.   PJB What year was that?   PK That would have been 1948 or 1949, somewhere along in there. Life was big then. That was in its heyday.   PJB So this is while you were attending Emory?   PK Yes, I graduated in, I got my bachelor's in 1949 ...   PJB This couldn't have been in photography?   PK No, it was in English. There were no photography programs then. There wasn't a school in the country in that type of thing. But then when I got married, I layed photography aside for eight or ten years. I had to make a living for my wife and my fast growing family.   PJB Would you say that going away, to some environment outside of the rural South, whether it be Atlanta, or New York City, or Paris, has helped you to see the value in your own landscape? Could you comment on anything that experience has given you?   PK Probably, but it's been so long ago. I mean, we're talking 40 something years ago. I don't remember that feeling particularly. I feel that my years at Emory were wasted. I really do. I don't know whether the four years spent away brought some things into relief that would not have been apparent to me. If it did, it was only on a subconscious level. But, I have always been a person who took pictures, even when I didn't have a camera with me. I mean, I would see something and think &quot;wow, what you could do with that if you had a camera,&quot; and so forth. I didn't get anything out of Emory, except a hell of a good time.   I had a wonderful time at college. I sewed all of my wild oats and, bless my mother and father's hearts, I don't know how they put up with me, or why they put up with me--they didn't kill me, and it's a wonder. But I didn't learn anything in particular at Emory; it didn't open any new doors for me. In fact, I don't think much of Emory, frankly.   PJB Turning to more technical aspects of your work, what is your film preference? Do you use slide film?   PK When I go out to photograph, I just shoot Tri-X. I much prefer to use prints to slides. With slides, you can see what the subject is, but you don't get the tactile feeling of a photograph. I've given three talks in the last six months and I had to use slides for two of them. One was at Georgia State in Atlanta to graduate photography students. I used prints in the talk because there was only about twenty to thirty people in the audience so we could pass prints around. I much prefer to use photographs to slides.   PJB What you've just called the &quot;tactile&quot; aspect of the photograph is interesting.   PK Well, the photograph is an object in its own right. It is not the thing it is a picture of. (Referring to a photograph) that's not a harbor, that's a picture of a harbor. If we're talking about photography, as I was with those students, then I think it's appropriate and better to have the object, the end product, what it's all directed toward, in your hand rather than a ten by fourteen foot projection of an image in a darkened room. You get no sense of the object.   PJB That's an interesting take on it. Have you ever worked in color?   PK I've never felt the need to. What I'm after comes through stronger in black and white.   Still looking through Understandings, we come across the photograph &quot;Mrs. Tomlinson in the House of Tomatoes,&quot; and our conversation   resumes.   PK That print--&quot;Mrs. Tomlinson in the House of Tomatoes&quot; has sold more than any print I've ever made.   PJB It does have a certain catchiness, a certain marketability to it.   PK Somebody wanted to put it on a t-shirt; I wouldn't allow it. I felt that that would be holding her up to ridicule. I couldn't see that at all. They wanted to put it on a t-shirt because it was such a funny image, and it is amusing, but there's more to it than that; it's more than amusing. There is substance to it too. I think people would laugh at it, because she's fat. No, I just wouldn't allow it.   I had a funny experience with that picture. It was featured in a show in Albany, Georgia. About 11:30 one night, my phone rang. When my phone rings that late at night, it scares me because I automatically think it's one of my four children or my grandchildren calling to tell me that something has happened or something. Boy, I grabbed the phone and this strange woman said, didn't say &quot;hello&quot; or anything, she just asked, &quot;did you make that picture of Mrs. Tomlinson?&quot; I said, &quot;who is this?&quot; She said, &quot;I'm Mrs. Tomlinson's daughter and my son lives in Donaldsonville,&quot; which is about twenty miles west of here, &quot;and he called me awhile ago and said 'Granny's picture is in the Albany Herald, and I want to know how I can get a copy of that picture.&quot;' The Albany museum was exhibiting it as part of this show. I had to get up, and go out and find a copy of the Albany Herald-it is, it's his granny. I spoke to him and told him that I would give him a small copy of it. It was used on an invitation for a show I had in New York a few years ago, so I was going to give him one of those that I had left over. She came by the next day to get it.   Well, about a week later, the director of the museum called me and said, &quot;Mr. Kwilecki, we've got some people over here who want to have their pictures made in front of 'Mrs. Tomlinson in the House of Tomatoes,' and I told them that we couldn't do that without your permission.&quot; I asked, &quot;who is it?,&quot; I had already figured who it was. The whole family had come in to pose in front of the picture in the museum. I said, &quot;please let them do it; it will be fine.&quot; And so they did and she (Mrs. Tomlinson's daughter) was perfectly happy. But that's granny. She's dead. That picture was made 21 years ago. The building has been torn down; there's a parking lot there now. Oh, she died a few years after the picture was made. She never knew I took it. No. I was walking by, on the sidewalk, and looked in and saw her. I had a Nikon with me. I didn't want her to move a muscle, so I took the camera off of my shoulder and released the mirror because the mirror is what makes so much noise when you fire a single lens reflex. If I had the Leica with me it wouldn't have made any difference, but with that camera, she would've looked up. She was intensely reading that paper. I walked in, getting as close as I dared to her, and I braced the camera on my thigh, away from my eye, mashed the button, and just turned around and walked out. She never even knew I was there, she was so preoccupied with reading The Enquirer.   PJB That sounds similar to a technique that William Eggleston has called &quot;shotgun&quot; photography. Have you ever heard him use that term?   PK Well, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't. You've got to be ready for failure when using that technique. Let me show you an interesting print. (Referring to the print) That's the full negative. Originally when I printed it, I straightened it up, which meant I had to crop some of the negatives. See, it's skewed because I wasn't looking through the viewfinder. For the first five or six, maybe ten years, I printed it this way (cropped). I constantly have to reprint it because I sell the prints. So at one point, I printed it full frame, and said &quot;hell no, that's the way to print it!&quot; There's a lot more tension in it tilted like that than it is neatly squared up. like the extra ceiling in that. You can see more of the chair. See, the chair is cut if you square it up over here. And the door is cut off. So, ever since, I've printed the whole negative.   PJB Yes, the ceiling really works into it. I see what you mean there. It almost gives the image a spiraling effect.   PK It wants to be printed very softly too like that, so that the light is mellow and gentle and just sort of flowing over the surface of things, and you can see back into those boxes, into the darkest corners and still see details.   The light down here is so soft and beautiful. If you shoot and print for that, you've got to get a long scale with particular emphasis on the midrange of tones. You don't want the spectacular, brilliant print; you want just enough black--real black and real white--to establish the scale. And bring up the middle tones. That's the way I print everything because that's characteristic of the light. That distinguishes the light here from the light in New Jersey, or some other place.   Well, now, in the winter light is sharper and more contrasted than it is in the summer. I put that down to the humidity in the air. I think it softens the light in the summer. I've never heard that that was the case, but that's my theory. The light is more contrasting in the winter. The sun's position, relative to the earth, throws shadows more than it does in the summer.   We had the British Olympic rowing team here this summer, getting ready for the Olympics in Atlanta. They wanted to practice in heat that would compare to what they will have to perform in. So, they came in July, and Bainbridge had a picnic for them in Willis Park. Of course, &quot;Willis Park&quot; is a major series of mine. I photograph all of the activities held there. Well, they were late getting there; it was hot as hell. The Bainbridge people got all the shady spots, and when they got there, they had to sit in the broiling sun. (laughs)   PJB Yeah, getting them ready.   PK But in the print of that scene you can see detail in the brightest things and in the darkest things. Shadows don't become black, and highlights don't become the color of the paper base itself. There's a real sense of vibrant light.   PJB That almost brings black and white up to color standards. When you're thinking about it in terms of different tonal qualities.   PK Well, there's two ways to print: you can either print to make the paper a beautiful object unto itself--Paul Strand did that--or, you can print to make the paper disappear so that the viewer has no consciousness of looking at a print at all but he's looking straight through the print, like it was glass, at the subject--Walker Evans did that. You make a choice because you have to do some manipulating either way. If it's going to be beautiful, you do some manipulating which is different from the manipulations you would do on the one in which you want the print to disappear. That's the way I think of it. The quality of the print that you end up with is the only thing that matters regardless of how you do it, whether you play mind games with yourself or not. I've always addressed it that way. And now, I don't think about it because I always print for the print to disappear. I never print to make it beautiful, the paper itself beautiful, but strictly to articulate the subject.
