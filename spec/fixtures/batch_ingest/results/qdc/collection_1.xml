  <dcterms:description>Three issues of the comic book series Vica by Vincent Krassousky produced in France during World War II. The Nazi-controlled government in German-occupied France produced the Vica comic during World War II as a propaganda tool against the Allied forces.

The author, Vincent Krassousky (also known as Vica), disappeared in the late 1940s.</dcterms:description>
